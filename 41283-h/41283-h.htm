<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In preparing the Second Edition of this little volume
of tales from the Northern Mythology for the press,
the Authors have thought it advisable to omit the
conversations at the beginning and end of the
chapters, which had been objected to as breaking the
course of the narrative. They have carefully revised
the whole, corrected many inaccuracies and added
fresh information drawn from sources they had not
had an opportunity of consulting when the volume
first appeared. The writers to whose works the
Authors have been most indebted, are Simrock,
Mallet, Laing, Thorpe, Howitt and Dasent.</p>

<hr class="partbreak" />


<div>
<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>If we would understand the religion of the ancient
Scandinavians, we ought to study at the same
time the myths of all Teutonic nations. A drawing
together of these, and a comparison of one
with another, has been most beautifully effected
by Simrock, in his <i>Handbuch der Deutschen
Mythologie</i>, where he tells us that whilst the
Scandinavian records are richer and more definite,
they are also younger than those of Germany,
which latter may be compared to ancient half
choked-up streams from which the fuller river
flows, but which, it is to be remarked, that<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" id="Page_10" title="[Pg 10]"></a>
river has mingled in its flowing. Grimm says that
both religions&mdash;the German and the Northern&mdash;were
in the main identical, though in details
they varied; and as heathenism lingered longer in
Scandinavia than in any other part of Europe,
it is not surprising that there, rather than
anywhere else, we should find the old world
wants and hopes and fears, dark guesses, crude
imaginings, childlike poetic expressions, crystallised
into a pretty definite system of belief
and worship. Yes, we can walk through the
glittering ice halls of the old frozen faith, and
count its gems and wonder at its fearful
images; but the warm heart-reachings from which
they alike once flowed, we can only darkly feel,
at best but narrowly pry into here and there.
Ah! if we could but break up the poem again
into the syllables of the far off years.</p>

<p>The little tales which follow, drawn from the
most striking and picturesque of the Northern
myths, are put together in the simplest possible
form, and were written only with a design to
make the subject interesting to children. By-and-bye,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" id="Page_11" title="[Pg 11]"></a>
however, as we through their means become
in a slight degree acquainted with the characters
belonging to, and the parts played by, the various
deities of this mythology, it will not be uninteresting
to consider what their meaning may be, and to
try if we can trace the connection of one with
another. At present it seems best, as an introduction
to them&mdash;and without it they would be
scarcely intelligible&mdash;to give a very slight sketch
of the Northern mythology, as it is gathered from
the earliest Scandinavian sources, as well as a
short account of the sources from which it is
gathered.</p>

<p>Laing, in the introduction to his Translation
of the Heimskringla Saga, says,&mdash;"A nation's literature
is its breath of life, without which a nation
has no existence, is but a congregation of individuals.
During the five centuries in which the
Northmen were riding over the seas, and conquering
wheresoever they landed, the literature of the
people they overcame was locked up in a dead
language, and within the walls of monasteries. But
the Northmen had a literature of their own, rude<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" id="Page_12" title="[Pg 12]"></a>
as it was." Songs and sagas, mythical and heroic,
were the staple of this literature of the north; and
these appear to have been handed down by word of
mouth from skald to skald until about the beginning
of the twelfth century. Then Sæmund the Learned,
and others, began to commit them to writing.
Sæmund the Learned was born in Iceland about
the year 1057, fifty years after Christianity had
been positively established in that island. He
passed his youth in Germany, France, and Italy,
studying at one time with a famous master, "by
whom he was instructed in every kind of lore."
So full, indeed, did Sæmund's head become of all
that he had learnt, that he frequently "forgot the
commonest things," even his own name and
identity, so that when asked who he was, he
would give the name of any one he had been
reading about. He was also said to be an astrologer,
and a charming little anecdote is related of him in
this capacity, which, however, would be out of
place here. When he went back to Iceland, he
became priest of Oddi, instructed the people about
him, studied the old religion, and, besides writing<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" id="Page_13" title="[Pg 13]"></a>
a history of Norway and Iceland, which has been
lost, transcribed several of the mythic and heroic
songs of the North, which together form a collection
known by the name of the <i>Poetic</i>, <i>Elder</i>, or
<i>Sæmund's Edda</i>. The songs themselves are supposed
to date from about the eighth century;
Sæmund wrote them down in the twelfth. The
oldest copy of his original MS. is of the fourteenth
century, and this copy is now in the Royal
Library of Copenhagen. A few years ago they
were translated into English by B. Thorpe. So
much for the history of the <i>Elder Edda</i>&mdash;great-grandmother
the name is said to mean, but after
all she scarcely seems old enough to be called a
great-grandmother. We have traced her growing
up, and seen how she has dressed herself, and we
begin to think of her almost as a modern young
lady. When we listen to the odd jumble of tales
she tells us, too, we are more than half inclined
to quarrel with her, though without exactly knowing
whether it is with her youth or her age that
we find fault. You are too young to know what
you are talking about, great-grandmother, we complain;<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" id="Page_14" title="[Pg 14]"></a>
but, oh dear! you mumble so and make
use of such odd old-fashioned words we can scarcely
understand you. Sæmund was not the only man
who wrote down songs and sagas; he had some
contemporaries, many successors; and, about fifty
years after his death, we hear of Snorro Sturleson,
a rich man, twice Supreme Magistrate of the
Icelandic Republic, who also lived for some time
at Oddi, and who has left many valuable additions
to the stock of Icelandic written lore. Laing says
of him&mdash;"Snorro Sturleson has done for the
history of the Northmen, what Livy did for the
history of the Romans." Amongst other things, he
wrote a sort of commentary or enlargement of
Sæmund's <i>Edda</i>, probably drawn from MSS. of
Sæmund and of others, which were preserved at Oddi.
This is called the <i>Prose</i>, <i>Younger</i>, or <i>Snorro's
Edda</i>, and was translated many years ago by M.
Mallet into French. Added to these two sources
of information respecting the Scandinavian mythology,
there are many allusions to the myths
scattered through the heroic lays with which
Northern literature abounds.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" id="Page_15" title="[Pg 15]"></a></p>

<p>The <i>Poetic Edda</i> consists of two parts&mdash;the
mythological and the heroic. The mythological
songs contain an account of the formation and
destruction of the world, of the origin, genealogies,
adventures, journeys, conversations of the gods,
magic incantations, and one lay which may be
called ethical. This portion of the <i>Edda</i> concludes
with a song called "The Song of the
Sun," of which it is supposed Sæmund himself
was the author. Thorpe, the English translator,
says, "It exhibits a strange mixture of Christianity
and heathenism, whence it would seem that the
poet's own religion was in a transition state. We
may as well remark here that the only allusion
to Christianity in the <i>Elder Edda</i>, with the exception
of this last song, which stands quite alone, is a
single strophe in an incantation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"An eighth I will sing to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If night overtake thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When out on the misty way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the dead Christian woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No power may have to do thee harm."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Which savours curiously of the horror which<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" id="Page_16" title="[Pg 16]"></a>
these heathens then evidently felt of the new
faith.</p>

<p>The <i>Younger Edda</i> is a very queer old lady
indeed. She begins by telling a sort of story. She
says "there was once a King called Gylfi, renowned
for his wisdom and skill in magic;" he being seized
with a desire to know all about the gods, and
wishing also to get his information first-hand, sets
off on a journey to Asgard itself, the gods' own
abode. When he gets there he finds a mysterious
Three seated upon three thrones&mdash;the High, the
Equally High, and the Third. The story-teller is
supposed to have taken this picture from a temple at
Upsal, where the thrones of Odin, Thor, and Frey
were placed in the same manner, one above another.
Gylfi introduces himself as Gangler, a name for
traveller (connected with the present Scotch word
gang), and proceeded to question the Three upon the
origin of the world, the nature and adventures
of the gods, &amp;c., &amp;c. Gangler's questions, and
the answers which he receives, will, with reference
to the <i>Elder Edda</i> tales, help us to get just the
short summary we want of the Scandinavian mythology&mdash;the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" id="Page_17" title="[Pg 17]"></a>
mythology grown up and old, and
frozen tight, as we find it in the <i>Eddas</i>.</p>

<p>"What was the beginning of things?" asks Gangler;
and Har (the highest of the Three), replying in the
words of an ancient poem, says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Once was the age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all was not&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sand, nor sea,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No earth was found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor over-skies,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And nowhere grass."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This nothingness was called Ginnungagap, the gap
of gaps, the gaping of the chasms: and Har goes on
to relate what took place in it. On the north side of
Ginnungagap, he says, lay Niflheim, the shadowy
nebulous home of freezing cold and gathering gloom;
but on the south lay the glowing region of Muspellheim.
There was besides a roaring cauldron
called Hvergelmir, which seethed in the middle of
Niflheim, and sent forth twelve rivers called the
strange waves; these flowed into the gap and froze
there, and so filled the gap with ice: but sparks<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" id="Page_18" title="[Pg 18]"></a>
and flakes of fire from Muspellheim fell upon the
ice. Ginnungagap on the north side was now
filled with ice and vapour and fleeting mists and
whirlwinds, but southwards with glowing radiancy,
with calm and light and wind&mdash;still air; and so,
continues Har, the heat met the frost, the frost
melted into drops, the drops quickened into life,
and there was a human form called Ymir, a giant.
"Was he a god?" asks Gangler. "Oh! dear no,"
answers Har; "we are very far indeed from believing
him to have been a god; he was wicked and the
father of all the Frost Giants." "I wonder what he
ate?" said Gangler. "There was a cow," Har went
on to explain; "she was made out of the drops,
too, and the giant fed upon her milk." "Good,"
answered Gangler; "but what fed the cow?" "She
licked the stones of Ginnungagap, which were
covered with salt hoar frost;" and then Har goes
on to relate how by degrees a man, Bur, grew up
out of the stones as the cow licked them, good,
not like Ymir, but the father of the gods; and here
we may remark that the giant and the god equally
were the sole progenitors of their immediate descendants.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" id="Page_19" title="[Pg 19]"></a>
Ymir was the father of the first giant, Bur
had a son called Bör. But after that the races mix
to a certain extent, for Bör married a giantess and
became the father of three sons, Odin, Vili and Ve.</p>

<p>"Was there any degree of good understanding
between these two races?" asks Gangler. "Far
from it," replies Har; and then he tells how the
sons of the god slew all the frost giants but one,
dragged the body of old Ymir into the middle of
Ginnungagap, made the earth out of it,&mdash;"from his
blood the seas, from his flesh the land, from his
bones the mountains, of his hair the trees, of his
skull the heavens and of his brains the clouds.
Then they took wandering flakes from Muspellheim,
and placed them in the heavens." Until this time,
says the <i>Völuspá</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"The sun knew not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she a dwelling had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon knew not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What power he possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars knew not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where they had a station."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>About this time it happened that the sons of
the god took a walk along the sea-beach, and there<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" id="Page_20" title="[Pg 20]"></a>
found two stems of wood which they fashioned into
the first man and woman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>After this it is said that the all-holy gods, the
Æsir, the Lords, went to their judgment seats, held
council, and gave names to the "night and to the
waning moon, morn, midday, afternoon, and eve
whereby to reckon years." Then they built a city
called Asgard in the middle of the earth, altars and
temples, "made furnaces, forged tongs and fabricated
tools and precious things;" after which they stayed
at home and played joyously with tables. This
was the golden age of the gods; they were happy.
"To them," says the old song, "was naught the
want of gold, until there came three maids all
powerful from the giants."</p>

<p>In some mysterious way it appears that a desire
for gold seized upon the gods in the midst of their
innocent golden play. Then they formed the dwarfs,
in order that these might get gold for them out of the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" id="Page_21" title="[Pg 21]"></a>
earth. The dwarfs till then had been just like maggots
in Ymir's dead flesh, but now received human
likeness. A shadow begins to creep over the earth,
the golden age is past. At the same time three
things happen. The gods discover the use or
want of gold; the first war breaks out, as it is said,
"Odin hurled his spear amid the people, and then
was the first war;" and the three all-powerful giant
maids appear. "Gold," says the old song (and calls
her by a name as if she were a person), "they pierced
with lances,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"And in the High one's Hall<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The three giant maidens are the three Fates&mdash;the
sisters,&mdash;Past, Present and Future. They came
from giant land, which in this place typifies the
first mixed cause of all things; they came at the
moment when the golden age was disappearing; they<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" id="Page_22" title="[Pg 22]"></a>
stand upon the very edge of its existence, at once
the bringers and the avengers of evil. "The golden
age ceased when gold was invented," is an old
saying. "After the golden age, time begins<span class="corr" title="added: ,">,</span>" is
another, or, in the words of a German proverb,
"To the happy no hour strikes." And now let
us see what sort of looking world these giants, gods,
men, dwarfs and fateful maids whom Har has been
talking about were living in.</p>

<p>"Round without," Har says so; but a <em>flat</em> round.
The outmost circle a frozen region full of frost
giants; inside that circle, the sea; in the middle of
the sea, the earth in which men live, called Midgard,
and made out of Ymir's eyebrows; in the midst of
the earth Asgard, the city of the gods. It seems
to be rather a disputed point whether or not Asgard
was on the top of a hill. Heavenly mountains are
mentioned in the <i>Edda</i>, but they are placed at the
edge of heaven under one end of the rainbow, not
at all near Asgard, if Asgard was in the middle of
the earth. However, to make the city more conspicuous
we have placed it on the summit of a hill
in the picture of the Scandinavian World which<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" id="Page_23" title="[Pg 23]"></a>
stands at the beginning of this chapter, and here
remark that this picture must not be looked at
exactly in a geographical light even from a Scandinavian
point of view. It is rather an expression of
ideas than of places, for we have tried to figure by
it what is said about the great World Tree Yggdrassil
and its three roots. "That ash," says Har, which
was indeed the earth-bearer, "is the greatest and
best of all trees." Its branches spread over the
whole world and even reach above heaven. It
has three roots, very wide asunder. One of them
goes down to Ginnungagap. The frost giants live
over it, and over this root is a deep well which we
shall hear more of by-and-bye. In the picture this
root could not be shown, but the branches which
encircle the ice region are supposed to spring from
it. Another root extends to Niflheim, the old roaring
cauldron lies under it, a great snake called Nidhögg
gnaws it night and day as the old lay says.
"Yggdrasil's ash suffers greater hardship than
men know of. Nidhögg tears it." Under this root
also lies Helheim, a home of the dead. The third
root is in heaven: gods and men live under it, in<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" id="Page_24" title="[Pg 24]"></a>
Asgard and Midgard; the giant fate-sisters also live
under it, at the top of the Rainbow's arch in their
palace very beauteous, which stands by the Holy
Urda Fount. They water the tree every day with
the holy water, so that ever "it stands green over
Urda's Fount."</p>

<p>These maidens are called Norns;&mdash;they fix the
destinies of men, Har says; "but besides them,"
he adds, "there are a great many other norns&mdash;indeed,
for each man that is born there is a norn
to decide his fate."</p>

<p>"Methinks, then," says Gangler, "that these Norns
were born far asunder; they are not of the same
race." "Some belong to the Æsir, some come
from the Elves, and some are dwarfs' daughters."
Besides these wonders, we are told that an eagle
perched amongst the highest branches of Yggdrasil
with a hawk between his eyes, four harts ran
amongst the branches and bit off the buds, and a
squirrel called Ratatösk or branch borer ran up
and down, carrying messages between the Eagle
and Nidhögg, as one account says, causing strife
between them&mdash;a kind of typical busybody, in fact.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" id="Page_25" title="[Pg 25]"></a></p>

<p>Such is the myth of Yggdrasil, of which Jacob
Grimm remarks "it bears the stamp of a very
high antiquity, but does not appear to be fully
unfolded." Of course, it was only the symbol of
a thought, the Scandinavians could not have believed
that there was such a tree. But of what thought
was it the symbol? The editor of Mallet's <i>Northern
Antiquities</i> says, "We are inclined to regard
this mythic Tree as the symbol of ever-enduring
time, or rather of universal nature, ever varying
in its aspects but subsisting throughout eternity."
It is called somewhere "Time's hoary nurse," and
we see the principles of destruction and of renovation
acting upon it. One root in the formless elemental
abyss, one in the formed ice-frozen-over giant land,
its branches spreading over the whole world; one
reaching up to the unseen. Its name means "Ygg"&mdash;terror,
horror, fear&mdash;"drasil"&mdash;horse or bearer&mdash;and
the first syllable is one of the names of Odin
the chief god. We must not omit to mention that
our Maypoles and the German Christmas trees are
offshoots of Yggdrasil, "that ash, the greatest and
best of trees."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" id="Page_26" title="[Pg 26]"></a></p>

<p>"But who is the first and eldest of the gods?"
Gangler asks. "We call him Allfather," says Har,
"but besides this he has twelve names."</p>

<p>Allfather, Odin or Woden, the eldest son of
Bör by a giantess, is the chief god of the <i>Eddas</i>,
and it is quite true, as Har says, that he has many
names. He was called Allfather&mdash;the father of gods
and men, and Valfather or the chooser, because he
chose which of the slain in battle should come and
live with him in heaven; he called himself by many
names when he travelled, he was known as Ygg,
but generally, chiefly, he was Odin. The meaning
of the first syllable of this last name is terror (like
Ygg), or violent emotion. Simrock says that air
in calm or storm lies at the root of Odin's being;
from this he grew up to be a god of the spirit, a
king of gods, "as in the simple ideas of the people,"
he says, "nature and spirit are inseparable; he became
as much a commander of the spirits of men as of
the forces of nature." Air, widespread and most
spiritual of the elements, how naturally akin it seems
to that wind, blowing where it listeth, which moves
in hidden ways the spirits of men. Inspiration,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" id="Page_27" title="[Pg 27]"></a>
madness, poetry, warrior-rage, the storm of wind,
the storm of mind&mdash;we find Odin in them all. Thor
the thunder-god stood next in importance to Odin.
Odin was his father, and he had a giantess mother,
Jörd (the earth). Besides these Har enumerates
Baldur, Tyr, Vidar, Vali, Hödur, Bragi, all called
sons of Odin;&mdash;we shall hear the stories that belong
to them by-and-bye.</p>

<p>All these were of the race of the Æsir or Asgard
gods; there were other deities counted amongst them,
and yet kept a little distinct&mdash;the Vanir gods and
goddesses. These were of a different race, and it
is not clear how and when they became mixed with
the Æsir. What the <i>Eddas</i> say about it is simply
this, that the Æsir made peace with the Vanir and
exchanged hostages with them. Amongst these we
find Niörd a kind of sea-coast god, the original
of Nipen still known in Norway, his son and
daughter Frey and Freyja, "beauteous and mighty,"&mdash;Frey
presiding over rain, sunshine, and the fruits
of the earth; Freyja goddess of the beautiful year
and of love, and Heimdall, a god who lived upon
the heavenly hills at one end of the rainbow. A<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" id="Page_28" title="[Pg 28]"></a>
sea-king called Ægir, whose nature is not quite
defined whether he belonged to the god or the giant
is occasionally mentioned in the <i>Edda</i> tales, and
also a wise giant Mimer. But there is besides a
mysterious being whom we name last because he
requires a little explanation. This is Loki. He
was one of the Æsir; we read of his being with
Odin when that god took his fateful walk along the
seashore and made man, he helped Odin in the
work; we come upon him frequently travelling with
the gods, sometimes at least as a friend, and
yet it is evident that Loki was looked upon as an
evil being. "Some call him the calumniator of
the gods," says Har, "the contriver of all fraud and
mischief, the disgrace of gods and men. Loki is
handsome," he adds, "and well made, but of a very
fickle mood and most evil disposition. He surpasses
all beings in those arts called cunning and
perfidy." Simrock says that fire lies at the root of
Loki's being as air lies in that of Odin,&mdash;fire
which has good and evil in it, but most outwardly
<em>destructive</em> power; hence the beginning of the idea
of his evil-heartedness. From simple nature myths,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" id="Page_29" title="[Pg 29]"></a>
it is quite easy to conceive that the moral principle,
as it grew up in a people, would develop spiritual
ones, and the character of the gods would materially
alter with the growth of the religion. Good and
evil are scarcely conceptions which the wars of the
elements give birth to. By the law is the knowledge
of sin. The name of Loki, it is said, may mean the
bright element.</p>

<p>Amongst the goddesses who were called Asyniur,
Frigga stands out chief in the <i>Eddas</i> as Odin's wife,
but several others are named, and also the Valkyrior,
swayers of the battle and heavenly serving maidens.
The peace between the Æsir and the Vanir, and
the perceptible difference between these races of gods,
points to an amalgamation of the religions of two
tribes of Teutons in very early times: their faiths
would be similar, drawn indeed from one source,
but would have been modified by the circumstances
and requirements of the divergent tribes. Simrock
supposes that the Vanir worshippers may have been
dwellers by the sea, and have had a special reverence
for wind and water deities&mdash;mild, wide, beneficent
airs. Their gods are a little milder in nature than<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" id="Page_30" title="[Pg 30]"></a>
those of Asgard, they are also more purely nature
deities, with less of the moral element in their characters,
which looks as if the two faiths had joined at different
stages of development, at different levels one
may say, so that the line between them is still
discernible. We have seen how Har explains to
Gangler the formation of the universe in Ginnungagap
out of the strange ice waves; primeval giant;
beneficent might of the gods; its endurance,
rooted in the mighty Tree, that reached from depth
to height,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Laved with limpid water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gnawed by more serpents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than any one would think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of witless mortals."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He had also something to say concerning the
future of the world. "What hast thou to tell me
about it?" said Gangler; and Har replied,&mdash;"In
the first place there will come a winter;" and
then he described the destruction of the world&mdash;flood
and storm, and ice and fire, and warfare, a
supreme conflict; all the powers of evil, the
chaotic powers&mdash;primeval chaos surging again out<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" id="Page_31" title="[Pg 31]"></a>
of Niflheim and Muspellheim&mdash;on one side, the
gods, the forming orderly principle of the course
of the universe, on the other&mdash;all rage within,
and through the mighty ash, which itself trembles,
"Groans that aged tree." Monsters and gods
alike fall, killing each other, and one cannot say
with whom the victory lies; for though the sun,
moon, and stars are made away with, and the
earth sinks into the flood, it soon emerges again,
"beauteously green," destined, as it would seem,
to run a second course. Brighter, purer? The
account is so mixed that one cannot say, and
why should we puzzle over it; perhaps they
knew as little what they thought and hoped as
we know about them&mdash;those old song-singers and
myth-spinners of days gone by, as one of them
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Few may see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Further forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than when Odin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meets the wolf."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Notwithstanding, we cannot help feeling, as we
contemplate this myth, that there was something
noble, very grimly courageous in its fatalism.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" id="Page_32" title="[Pg 32]"></a>
Simrock says, "the course of Northern mythology
is like a drama." The world's beginning, the
golden years, the first shadow of evil, evil that
came with times, evil fated to come, the troubles
of various kinds, all death shadows which fell
upon the gods (we shall trace them in the
following tales); and above all, hanging over all,
crowning all, the twilight, the struggle, the end,
the renewing; for it is not, be it observed, the
end of the world, of time, of succession of events
that is recorded in this myth (called the Ragnarök
Myth), but rather of the struggling powers that
had been brought by these, that had formed
these. Looking through this drama two things
chiefly strike us, fatalism and combat. The two
do not contradict one another. The gods fight
the giants from the earliest times; they go on
fighting them in a thousand ways, even though
they know that their own final defeat and
destruction are fixed&mdash;they ward off the evil day
as far as possible, hoping through its shadow
again and again, dauntless to the end. It is
impossible to help admiring the impulses which<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" id="Page_33" title="[Pg 33]"></a>
led to the building up, and dictated the worship
of this idea,&mdash;the worship of the gods who were
to die, who were, in spite of most courageous
defiance of it, after all but the servants of the
inevitable. Of course it was perfectly simple and
natural that this conception of unceasing strife,
of the alternate victory and defeat of light and
darkness, cold and heat, should arise in the
minds of any worshippers of the natural world,
but it must, one would think, have acquired
some moral significance to these heathen Northmen
by the time that Odin had come to be
Allfather, even Valfather, and Frigga, through the
nourishing earth, the lady of married love and
of the hearth. A good deal of this courageous
spirit of conflict and self-surrender comes
into the Scandinavian myths and heroic tales.
We read of one of the gods' messengers, who,
when implored to desist from an undertaking because
danger threatened, replied, "For one day
was my age decreed and my whole life determined."
In a lay of Odin, it says, "We ourselves
die, but the fair fame never dies of him who<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" id="Page_34" title="[Pg 34]"></a>
has earned it;" and this reminds us of the
Scandinavian custom of engraving the records of
their warlike deeds upon their shields. "When a
young warrior was at first enlisted," it is said,
"they gave him a white and smooth buckler,
which was called the 'shield of expectation,'
which he carried until he had earned its record."
It is related of one of the celebrated Jomsburg
sea-rovers called Bui, that finding himself defeated
in an engagement, and seeing that all further
resistance was fruitless, he took his treasure&mdash;two
chests full of gold&mdash;and, calling out "Overboard
all Bui's men," plunged into the sea and perished.
But better far is the following:&mdash;"A warrior
having been thrown upon his back in wrestling
with his enemy, and the latter finding himself
without arms, the vanquished person promised to
wait without changing his posture while the other
fetched a sword to kill him, and he faithfully
kept his word."</p>

<p>Such traits as these lie on the light side of the
Northern character, pity that the other side is such a
dark one. Craft, avarice, cruelty&mdash;we cannot shut<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" id="Page_35" title="[Pg 35]"></a>
our eyes to them&mdash;cropping up everywhere, in the
stories of the gods, and still more frequently in the
sagas whose details are sometimes most revolting.
Amongst other stories, we have one of a young sea-rover,
called Sigurd, by-the-bye, a son of that very
Bui mentioned above. Sigurd and his companions
had been taken prisoners, and were condemned to
be beheaded. They were all seated on a log of wood,
and one after another had his head struck off, whilst
king Hakon their capturer looked on; the account
says, that he came out after breakfast to watch the
execution. The sea-rovers all met their fate with
unflinching courage, and as the executioner asked
each one, before he struck the blow, what he thought
of death, each gave some fierce mocking answer;
but when it came to Sigurd's turn, and he was asked
what he thought of death, he answered, "I fear not
death, since I have fulfilled the greatest duty of life,
but I must pray thee not to let my hair be touched
by a slave, or stained with my blood." The story
tells us he had long fair hair, as fine as silk,
flowing in ringlets over his shoulders. One of the
cruel king Hakon's followers, being moved, it<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" id="Page_36" title="[Pg 36]"></a>
seems, either with pity for Sigurd's hair or admiration
of his courage, stept forward and held the ringlets
whilst the executioner struck, upon which Sigurd
twitched his head forward so strongly that the warrior
who was holding his hair had both his hands cut off,
"and this practical joke so pleased the king's son,"
continues the tale, "that he gave Sigurd his life."</p>

<p>"Thou tellest me many wonderful things," said
Gangler; "what are the names of the Homesteads
in heaven?" In answer, Har tells him about Odin's
halls, and Thor's, and Baldur's, and Frigga's, and
many another bounteous, wide-spreading, golden-roofed
mansion; amongst them of Valhalla, which Odin had
prepared especially for warriors who fell in battle
and who were thenceforth to be his sons, called
Einherjar, heroes, champions. "Methinks," said
Gangler, "there must be a great crowd in Valhalla,
and often a great press at the door among such a
number of people constantly thronging in and out."
"Why not ask," says Har, "how many doors there
are?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Five hundred doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forty eke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think are in Valhall.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" id="Page_37" title="[Pg 37]"></a>
"But what does Odin give the warriors to eat?"
asked Gangler. "The flesh of the good boar Sæhrimnir,
and this is more than enough (though few know
how much is required for heroes), for in spite of its
being eaten every day it becomes whole again every
night; truly it is the best of flesh." "And what have
the heroes to drink?" asked Gangler "for they must
require a plentiful supply; do they drink only water?"
"A silly question that," replied Har; "dost thou
imagine that Allfather would invite kings and jarls
and other great men and give them nothing to drink
but water? In that case the heroes would think
they had paid dearly to get to Valhall, enduring
great hardships and receiving deadly wounds; they
would find they had paid too great a price for water
drink. No, no, the case is quite otherwise, in
Valhall there is a famous goat that supplies mead
enough for all the heroes and to spare." "Mighty
things these," said Gangler; "but how do the heroes
amuse themselves when they are not drinking?"
"Every day they ride into the court and fight till
they cut each other in pieces, this is their pastime;
but when meal-tide approaches they return to drink<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" id="Page_38" title="[Pg 38]"></a>
in Valhall." "Odin is great and mighty," answered
Gangler, "as it is said in one of the Æsir's own
poems,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"The ash Yggdrasill<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"But do all the dead go to Valhalla?" No; down
below in Niflheim there was another home of the
dead which was ruled over by the underworld
goddess Hela, and called after her Helheim. Coldness
and discomfort, according to one account,
were rather its characteristics than actual suffering;
and as all the dead were said to go there who died
of sickness or old age, it was probably at one time
regarded more as a place of misfortune than of
punishment. The cold, hidden-away condition of
the dead, separated from the bright, warm life of
the upper world, would naturally suggest their being
consigned to the keeping of some under-world deity,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" id="Page_39" title="[Pg 39]"></a>
unless, indeed, they could lay claim to a second higher
life by virtue of any great warlike deed done up
here. By degrees misfortune must have deepened
into suffering; and, as the moral sense quickened,
the idea would arise of there being a retribution for
misdeeds done on earth as well as an emptiness of
its missed glories. There is a description given of
some place of punishment&mdash;it is not quite clear what
place it refers to&mdash;in these words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now," says Har; that was when he had finished<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" id="Page_40" title="[Pg 40]"></a>
his description of Ragnarök, "If thou, Gangler, hast
any more questions to ask, I know not who can
answer thee, for I never heard tell of any one who
could relate what will happen in the other ages of
the world." "Upon which," the story says, "Gangler
heard a terrible noise all round him; he looked
everywhere, but could see neither palace, nor city,
nor any thing save a vast plain. He therefore set
out on his return home." And so disappears king
Gylfi.</p>

<p>But we, who are not so presumptuous as to enquire
into the future of the ages, and are neither learned
nor over inquisitive like king Gylfi, will go on
listening to the great-grandmothers' stories, giant
stories and god stories&mdash;a little bit that one remembers,
and a little bit that another remembers, and so
on; and all the time we will try to make the story
tellers clear to one another and to ourselves as they
go on, translating their old fashioned words into our
own common every day words and modes of speech,
so that we may have at least a chance of understanding
them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />
THE ÆSIR.</h2>


<h3><a name="I_I_A_GIANT" id="I_I_A_GIANT"></a>PART I. A GIANT&mdash;A COW&mdash;AND A HERO.</h3>

<p>In the beginning of ages there lived a cow, whose
breath was sweet, and whose milk was bitter. This
cow was called Audhumla, and she lived all by
herself on a frosty, misty plain, where there was
nothing to be seen but heaps of snow and ice
piled strangely over one another. Far away to the
north it was night, far away to the south it was
day; but all around where Audhumla lay a cold,
grey twilight reigned. By-and-by a giant came out
of the dark north, and lay down upon the ice near<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" id="Page_42" title="[Pg 42]"></a>
Audhumla. "You must let me drink of your milk,"
said the giant to the cow; and though her milk
was bitter, he liked it well, and for him it was
certainly good enough.</p>

<p>After a little while the cow looked all round her
for something to eat, and she saw a very few grains
of salt sprinkled over the ice; so she licked the
salt, and breathed with her sweet breath, and then
long golden locks rose out of the ice, and the
southern day shone upon them, which made them
look bright and glittering.</p>

<p>The giant frowned when he saw the glitter of the
golden hair; but Audhumla licked the pure salt
again, and a head of a man rose out of the ice.
The head was more handsome than could be
described, and a wonderful light beamed out of
its clear blue eyes. The giant frowned still more
when he saw the head; but Audhumla licked the
salt a third time, and then an entire man arose&mdash;a
hero majestic in strength and marvellous in beauty.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that when the giant looked
full in the face of that beautiful man, he hated him
with his whole heart, and, what was still worse, he<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" id="Page_43" title="[Pg 43]"></a>
took a terrible oath, by all the snows of Ginnungagap,
that he would never cease fighting until either
he or Bur, the hero, should lie dead upon the
ground. And he kept his vow; he did not cease
fighting until Bur had fallen beneath his cruel blows.
I cannot tell how it could be that one so wicked
should be able to conquer one so majestic and so
beautiful; but so it was, and afterwards, when the
sons of the hero began to grow up, the giant and
his sons fought against them, too, and were very
near conquering them many times.</p>

<p>But there was of the sons of the heroes one of
very great strength and wisdom, called Odin, who,
after many combats, did at last slay the great old
giant, and pierced his body through with his keen
spear, so that the blood swelled forth in a mighty
torrent, broad and deep, and all the hideous giant
brood were drowned in it excepting one, who ran
away panting and afraid.</p>

<p>After this Odin called round him his sons, brothers,
and cousins, and spoke to them thus: "Heroes,
we have won a great victory; our enemies are dead,
or have run away from us. We cannot stay any<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" id="Page_44" title="[Pg 44]"></a>
longer here, where there is nothing evil for us to
fight against."</p>

<p>The heroes looked round them at the words of
Odin. North, south, east, and west there was no
one to fight against them anywhere, and they called
out with one voice, "It is well spoken, Odin; we
follow you."</p>

<p>"Southward," answered Odin, "heat lies, and
northward night. From the dim east the sun
begins his journey westward home."</p>

<p>"Westward home!" shouted they all; and westward
they went.</p>

<p>Odin rode in the midst of them, and they all paid
to him reverence and homage as to a king and
father. On his right hand rode Thor, Odin's strong,
warlike, eldest son. On his left hand rode Baldur,
the most beautiful and exalted of his children; for
the very light of the sun itself shone forth from his
pure and noble brow. After him came Tyr the
Brave; the Silent Vidar; <a class="corr" name="corr_1" id="corr_1" title="was: Hodur">Hödur</a>, who, alas! was
born blind; Hermod, the Flying Word; Bragi,
<a class="corr" name="corr_2" id="corr_2" title="was: Hænir">Hœnir</a>, and many more mighty lords and heroes;
and then came a shell chariot, in which sat Frigga,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" id="Page_45" title="[Pg 45]"></a>
the wife of Odin, with all her daughters, friends,
and tirewomen.</p>

<p>Eleven months they journeyed westward, enlivening
the way with cheerful songs and conversation,
and at the twelfth new moon they pitched their
tents upon a range of hills which stood near the
borders of an inland sea. The greater part of one
night they were disturbed by mysterious whisperings,
which appeared to proceed from the sea-coast,
and creep up the mountain side; but as Tyr, who
got up half a dozen times, and ran furiously about
among the gorse and bushes, always returned
saying that he could see no one, Frigga and her
maidens at length resigned themselves to sleep,
though they certainly trembled and started a good
deal at intervals. Odin lay awake all night, however;
for he felt certain that something unusual
was going to happen. And such proved to be the
case; for in the morning, before the tents were
struck, a most terrific hurricane levelled the poles,
and tore in pieces the damask coverings, swept
from over the water furiously up the mountain
gorges, round the base of the hills, and up again<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" id="Page_46" title="[Pg 46]"></a>
all along their steep sides right in the faces of the
heroes.</p>

<p>Thor swung himself backwards and forwards, and
threw stones in every possible direction. Tyr sat
down on the top of a precipice, and defied the winds
to displace him; whilst Baldur vainly endeavoured
to comfort his poor mother, Frigga. But Odin
stepped forth calm and unruffled, spread his arms
towards the sky, and called out to the spirits of the
wind, "Cease, strange Vanir (for that was the name
by which they were called), cease your rough play,
and tell us in what manner we have offended you that
you serve us thus."</p>

<p>The winds laughed in a whispered chorus at the
words of the brave king, and, after a few low titterings,
sank into silence. But each sound in dying
grew into a shape: one by one the strange, loose-limbed,
uncertain forms stepped forth from caves,
from gorges, dropped from the tree tops, or rose
out of the grass&mdash;each wind-gust a separate Van.</p>

<p>Then Niörd, their leader, stood forward from the
rest of them, and said, "We know, O mighty Odin
how you and your company are truly the Æsir&mdash;that<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" id="Page_47" title="[Pg 47]"></a>
is to say, the lords of the whole earth&mdash;since you
slew the huge, wicked giant. We, too, are lords,
not of the earth, but of the sea and air, and we
thought to have had glorious sport in fighting one
against another; but if such be not your pleasure,
let us, instead of that, shake hands." And, as he
spoke, Niörd held out his long, cold hand, which
was like a windbag to the touch. Odin grasped
it heartily, as did all the Æsir; for they liked the
appearance of the good-natured, gusty chief, whom
they begged to become one of their company, and
live henceforth with them.</p>

<p>To this Niörd consented, whistled good-bye to
his kinsfolk, and strode cheerfully along amongst
his new friends. After this they journeyed on
and on steadily westward until they reached the
summit of a lofty mountain, called the Meeting
Hill. There they all sat round in a circle, and
took a general survey of the surrounding neighbourhood.</p>

<p>As they sat talking together Baldur looked up
suddenly, and said, "Is it not strange, Father Odin,
that we do not find any traces of that giant who<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" id="Page_48" title="[Pg 48]"></a>
fled from us, and who escaped drowning in his
father's blood?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has fallen into Niflheim, and so
perished," remarked Thor.</p>

<p>But Niörd pointed northward, where the troubled
ocean rolled, and said, "Yonder, beyond that sea,
lies the snowy region of Jötunheim. It is there
the giant lives, and builds cities and castles, and
brings up his children&mdash;a more hideous brood even
than the old one."</p>

<p>"How do you know that, Niörd?" asked Odin.</p>

<p>"I have seen him many times," answered Niörd,
"both before I came to live with you, and also
since then, at night, when I have not been able to
sleep, and have made little journeys to Jötunheim,
to pass the time away."</p>

<p>"This is indeed terrible news," said Frigga;
"for the giants will come again out of Jötunheim
and devastate the earth."</p>

<p>"Not so," answered Odin, "not so, my dear
Frigga; for here, upon this very hill, we will build
for ourselves a city, from which we will keep guard
over the poor earth, with its weak men and women,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" id="Page_49" title="[Pg 49]"></a>
and from whence we will go forth to make war
upon Jötunheim."</p>

<p>"That is remarkably well said, Father Odin,"
observed Thor, laughing amidst his red beard.</p>

<p>Tyr shouted, and Vidar smiled, but said nothing;
and then all the Æsir set to work with their
whole strength and industry to build for themselves
a glorious city on the summit of the mountain.
For days, and weeks, and months, and years they
worked, and never wearied; so strong a purpose
was in them, so determined and powerful were they
to fulfil it. Even Frigga and her ladies did not
disdain to fetch stones in their marble wheelbarrows,
or to draw water from the well in golden
buckets, and then, with delicate hands, to mix the
mortar upon silver plates. And so that city rose by
beautiful degrees, stone above stone, tower above
tower, height above height, until it crowned the hill.</p>

<p>Then all the Æsir stood at a little distance, and
looked at it, and sighed from their great happiness.
Towering at a giddy height in the centre of
the city rose Odin's seat, called Air Throne, from
whence he could see over the whole earth. On<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" id="Page_50" title="[Pg 50]"></a>
one side of Air Throne stood the Palace of Friends,
where Frigga was to live; on the other rose the
glittering Gladsheim, a palace roofed entirely with
golden shields, and whose great hall, Valhalla, had
a ceiling covered with spears, benches spread with
coats of mail, and five hundred and forty entrance-gates,
through each of which eight hundred men
might ride abreast. There was also a large iron
smithy, situated on the eastern side of the city,
where the Æsir might forge their arms and shape
their armour. That night they all supped in
Valhalla, and drank to the health of their strong,
new home, "The City of Asgard," as Bragi, their
chief orator, said it ought to be called.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" id="Page_51" title="[Pg 51]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="I_II_AIR_THRONE" id="I_II_AIR_THRONE"></a>PART II. AIR THRONE, THE DWARFS, AND THE LIGHT ELVES.</h3>

<p>In the morning Odin mounted Air Throne, and
looked over the whole earth, whilst the Æsir
stood all round waiting to hear what he thought
about it.</p>

<p>"The earth is very beautiful," said Odin, from
the top of his throne, "very beautiful in every
part, even to the shores of the dark North Sea;
but, alas! the men of the earth are puny and
fearful. At this moment I see a three-headed
giant striding out of Jötunheim. He throws a
shepherd-boy into the sea, and puts the whole of
the flock into his pocket. Now he takes them out
again one by one, and cracks their bones as if<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" id="Page_52" title="[Pg 52]"></a>
they were hazel-nuts, whilst, all the time, men
look on, and do nothing."</p>

<p>"Father," cried Thor in a rage, "last night I
forged for myself a belt, a glove, and a hammer,
with which three things I will go forth alone to
Jötunheim."</p>

<p>Thor went, and Odin looked again.</p>

<p>"The men of the earth are idle and stupid,"
said Odin. "There are dwarfs and elves, who live
amongst them, and play tricks which they cannot
understand, and do not know how to prevent. At
this moment I see a husbandman sowing grains of
wheat in the furrows, whilst a dwarf runs after
him, and changes them into stones. Again, I see
two hideous little beings, who are holding under
water the head of one, the wisest of men, until he
dies; they mix his blood with honey; they have
put it into three stone jars, and hidden it
away."</p>

<p>Then Odin was very angry with the dwarfs, for
he saw that they were bent on mischief; so he
called to him Hermod, his Flying Word, and
despatched him with a message to the dwarfs and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" id="Page_53" title="[Pg 53]"></a>
light elves, to say that Odin sent his compliments,
and would be glad to speak with them, in his palace
of Gladsheim, upon a matter of some importance.</p>

<p>When they received Hermod's summons the
dwarfs and light elves were very much surprised,
not quite knowing whether to feel honoured or
afraid. However, they put on their pertest manners,
and went clustering after Hermod like a
swarm of ladybirds.</p>

<p>When they were arrived in the great city they
found Odin descended from his throne, and sitting
with the rest of the Æsir in the Judgment Hall
of Gladsheim. Hermod flew in, saluted his master,
and pointed to the dwarfs and elves hanging like
a cloud in the doorway to show that he had fulfilled
his mission. Then Odin beckoned the little people
to come forward. Cowering and whispering they
peeped over one another's shoulders; now running
on a little way into the hall, now back again, half
curious, half afraid; and it was not until Odin had
beckoned three times that they finally reached his
footstool. Then Odin spoke to them in calm, low,
serious tones about the wickedness of their mischievous<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" id="Page_54" title="[Pg 54]"></a>
propensities. Some, the very worst of
them, only laughed in a forward, hardened manner;
but a great many looked up surprised and a little
pleased at the novelty of serious words; whilst the
light elves all wept, for they were tender-hearted
little things. At length Odin spoke to the two
dwarfs by name whom he had seen drowning the
wise man. "Whose blood was it," he asked,
"that you mixed with honey and put into jars?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the dwarfs, jumping up into the air,
and clapping their hands, "that was Kvasir's blood.
Don't you know who Kvasir was? He sprang up
out of the peace made between the Vanir and yourselves,
and has been wandering about these seven
years or more; so wise he was that men thought
he must be a god. Well, just now we found him
lying in a meadow drowned in his own wisdom; so
we mixed his blood with honey, and put it into
three great jars to keep. Was not that well done,
Odin?"</p>

<p>"Well done!" answered Odin. "Well done!
You cruel, cowardly, lying dwarfs! I myself saw
you kill him. For shame! for shame!" and then<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" id="Page_55" title="[Pg 55]"></a>
Odin proceeded to pass sentence upon them all.
Those who had been the most wicked, he said,
were to live, henceforth, a long way underground,
and were to spend their time in throwing fuel upon
the great earth's central fire; whilst those who had
only been mischievous were to work in the gold
and diamond mines, fashioning precious stones and
metals. They might all come up at night, Odin
said; but must vanish at the dawn. Then he
waved his hand, and the dwarfs turned round,
shrilly chattering, scampered down the palace-steps,
out of the city, over the green fields, to their unknown,
deep-buried earth-homes. But the light
elves still lingered, with upturned, tearful, smiling
faces, like sunshiny morning dew.</p>

<p>"And you," said Odin, looking them through
and through with his serious eyes, "and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! indeed, Odin," interrupted they, speaking
all together in quick, uncertain tones; "Oh! indeed,
Odin, we are not so very wicked. We have never
done anybody any harm."</p>

<p>"Have you ever done anybody any good?"
asked Odin.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" id="Page_56" title="[Pg 56]"></a></p>

<p>"Oh! no, indeed," answered the light elves,
<span class="corr" title='added: "'>"</span>we have never done anything at all."</p>

<p>"You may go, then," said Odin, "to live
amongst the flowers, and play with the wild bees
and summer insects. You must, however, find
something to do, or you will get to be mischievous
like the dwarfs."</p>

<p>"If only we had any one to teach us," said the
light elves, "for we are such foolish little people."</p>

<p>Odin looked round inquiringly upon the Æsir;
but amongst them there was no teacher found for
the silly little elves. Then he turned to Niörd,
who nodded his head good-naturedly, and said,
"Yes, yes, I will see about it;" and then he strode
out of the Judgment Hall, right away through the
city gates, and sat down upon the mountain's
edge.</p>

<p>After awhile he began to whistle in a most
alarming manner, louder and louder, in strong
wild gusts, now advancing, now retreating; then
he dropped his voice a little, lower and lower,
until it became a bird-like whistle&mdash;low, soft, enticing
music, like a spirit's call; and far away<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" id="Page_57" title="[Pg 57]"></a>
from the south a little fluttering answer came,
sweet as the invitation itself, nearer and nearer
until the two sounds dropped into one another.
Then through the clear sky two forms came
floating, wonderfully fair&mdash;a brother and sister&mdash;their
beautiful arms twined round one another,
their golden hair bathed in sunlight, and supported
by the wind.</p>

<p>"My son and daughter," said Niörd, proudly,
to the surrounding Æsir, "Frey and Freyja,
Summer and Beauty, hand in hand."</p>

<p>When Frey and Freyja dropped upon the hill
Niörd took his son by the hand, led him gracefully
to the foot of the throne, and said, "Look
here, dear brother Lord, what a fair young instructor
I have brought for your pretty little elves."</p>

<p>Odin was very much pleased with the appearance
of Frey; but, before constituting him king and
schoolmaster of the light elves, he desired to know
what his accomplishments were, and what he considered
himself competent to teach.</p>

<p>"I am the genius of clouds and sunshine,"
answered Frey; and as he spoke, the essences of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" id="Page_58" title="[Pg 58]"></a>
a hundred perfumes were exhaled from his breath.
"I am the genius of clouds and sunshine, and if
the light elves will have me for their king I can
teach them how to burst the folded buds, to set
the blossoms, to pour sweetness into the swelling
fruit, to lead the bees through the honey-passages
of the flowers, to make the single ear a stalk of
wheat, to hatch birds' eggs, and teach the little
ones to sing&mdash;all this, and much more," said Frey,
"I know, and will teach them."</p>

<p>Then answered Odin, "It is well;" and Frey
took his scholars away with him to Alfheim, which
is in every beautiful place under the sun.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" id="Page_59" title="[Pg 59]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="I_III_NIFLHEIM" id="I_III_NIFLHEIM"></a>PART III. NIFLHEIM.</h3>

<p>Now, in the city of Asgard dwelt one called Loki,
who, though amongst the Æsir, was not of the Æsir,
but utterly unlike to them; for to do the wrong, and
leave the right undone, was, night and day, this wicked
Loki's one unwearied aim. How he came amongst
the Æsir no one knew, nor even whence he came.
Once, when Odin questioned him on the subject,
Loki stoutly declared that there had been a time
when he was innocent and noble-purposed like the
Æsir themselves; but that, after many wanderings
up and down the earth, it had been his misfortune,
Loki said, to discover the half-burnt heart of a
woman; "since when," continued he, "I became<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" id="Page_60" title="[Pg 60]"></a>
what you now see me, Odin." As this was too
fearful a story for any one to wish to hear twice
over Odin never questioned him again.</p>

<p>Whilst the Æsir were building their city, Loki,
instead of helping them, had been continually running
over to Jötunheim to make friends amongst
the giants and wicked witches of the place. Now,
amongst the witches there was one so fearful to
behold in her sin and her cruelty, that one would
have thought it impossible even for such an one
as Loki to find any pleasure in her companionship:
nevertheless, so it was that he married her, and
they lived together a long time, making each
other worse and worse out of the abundance of
their own wicked hearts, and bringing up their
three children to be the plague, dread, and misery
of mankind. These three children were just what
they might have been expected to be from their
parentage and education. The eldest was Jörmungand,
a monstrous serpent; the second Fenrir,
most ferocious of wolves; the third was Hela, half
corpse, half queen. When Loki and his witch-wife
looked at their fearful progeny they thought<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" id="Page_61" title="[Pg 61]"></a>
within themselves, "What would the Æsir say if
they could see?" "But they cannot see," said
Loki; "and, lest they should suspect Witch-wife, I
will go back to Asgard for a little while, and salute
old Father Odin bravely, as if I had no secret
here." So saying, Loki wished his wife good-morning,
bade her hide the children securely in-doors,
and set forth on the road to Asgard.</p>

<p>But all the time he was travelling Loki's children
went on growing, and long before he had reached
the lofty city Jörmungand had become so large,
that his mother was obliged to open the door to
let his tail out. At first it hung only a little way
across the road; but he grew, Oh, how fearfully
Jörmungand grew! Whether it was from sudden
exposure to the air, I do not know; but, in a single
day he grew from one end of Jötunheim to the
other, and early next morning began to shoot out
in the direction of Asgard. Luckily, however, just
at that moment Odin caught sight of him, when,
from the top of Air Throne, the eyes of this vigilant
ruler were taking their morning walk. "Now,"
said Odin, "it is quite clear, Frigga, that I must<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" id="Page_62" title="[Pg 62]"></a>
remain in idleness no longer at Asgard, for monsters
are bred up in Jötunheim, and the earth has need
of me." So saying, descending instantly from
Air Throne, Odin went forth of Asgard's golden
gates to tread the earth of common men, fighting
to pierce through Jötunheim, and slay its
monstrous sins.</p>

<p>In his journeyings Odin mixed freely with the
people of the countries through which he passed;
shared with them toil and pleasure, war and grief;
taught them out of his own large experience, inspired
them with his noble thoughts, and exalted
them by his example. Even to the oldest he could
teach much; and in the evening, when the labours
of the day were ended, and the sun cast slanting
rays upon the village green, it was pleasant to
see the sturdy village youths grouped round that
noble chief, hanging open mouthed upon his words,
as he told them of his great fight with the
giant of long ago, and then pointing towards
Jötunheim, explained to them how that fight was
not yet over, for that giants and monsters grew
round them on every side, and they, too, might<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" id="Page_63" title="[Pg 63]"></a>
do battle bravely, and be heroes and Æsir of
the earth.</p>

<p>One evening, after thus drinking in his burning
words they all trooped together to the village
smithy, and Odin forged for them all night arms
and armour, instructing them, at the same time,
in their use. In the morning he said, "Farewell,
children; I have further to go than you can come;
but do not forget me when I am gone, nor how
to fight as I have taught you. Never cease to be
true and brave; never turn your arms against one
another; and never turn them away from the giant
and the oppressor."</p>

<p>Then the villagers returned to their homes and
their field-labour, and Odin pressed on, through
trackless uninhabited woods, up silent mountains,
over the lonely ocean, until he reached that strange,
mysterious meeting-place of sea and sky. There,
brooding over the waters like a grey sea fog, sat
Mimer, guardian of the well where wit and wisdom
lie hidden.</p>

<p>"Mimer," said Odin, going up to him boldly,
"let me drink of the waters of wisdom."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" id="Page_64" title="[Pg 64]"></a></p>

<p>"Truly, Odin," answered Mimer, "it is a great
treasure that you seek, and one which many have
sought before, but who, when they knew the price
of it, turned back."</p>

<p>Then replied Odin, "I would give my right
hand for wisdom willingly."</p>

<p>"Nay," rejoined the remorseless Mimer, "it is
not your right hand, but your right eye you must
give."</p>

<p>Odin was very sorry when he heard the words
of Mimer, and yet he did not deem the price too
great; for plucking out his right eye, and casting
it from him, he received in return a draught of
the fathomless deep. As Odin gave back the horn
into Mimer's hand he felt as if there were a
fountain of wisdom springing up within him&mdash;an
inward light; for which you may be sure he never
grudged having given his perishable eye. Now,
also, he knew what it was necessary for him to do
in order to become a really noble Asa,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and that
was to push on to the extreme edge of the earth
itself, and peep over into Niflheim. Odin knew<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" id="Page_65" title="[Pg 65]"></a>
it was precisely that he must do; and precisely
that he did. Onward and northward he went over
ice-bound seas, through twilight, fog, and snow,
right onward in the face of winds that were like
swords until he came into the unknown land, where
sobs, and sighs, and sad, unfinished shapes were
drifting up and down. "Then," said Odin, thoughtfully,
"I have come to the end of all creation,
and a little further on Niflheim must lie."</p>

<p>Accordingly he pushed on further and further
until he reached the earth's extremest edge, where,
lying down and leaning over from its last cold peak,
he looked into the gulf below. It was Niflheim. At
first Odin imagined that it was only empty darkness;
but, after hanging there three nights and
days, his eye fell on one of Yggdrasil's mighty
stems. Yggdrasil was the old earth-tree, whose
roots sprang far and wide, from Jötunheim, from
above, and this, the oldest of the three, out of
Niflheim. Odin looked long upon its time-worn,
knotted fibres, and watched how they were for ever
gnawed by Nidhögg the envious serpent, and his
brood of poisonous diseases. Then he wondered<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" id="Page_66" title="[Pg 66]"></a>
what he should see next; and one by one spectres
arose from Naströnd, the Shore of Corpses&mdash;arose
and wandered pale, naked, nameless, and without
a home. Then Odin looked down deeper into the
abyss of abysses, and saw all its shapeless, nameless
ills; whilst far below him, deeper than Naströnd,
Yggdrasil, and Nidhögg, roared Hvergelmir,
the boiling cauldron of evil. Nine nights and days
this brave wise Asa hung over Niflheim pondering.
More brave and more wise he turned away from
it than when he came. It is true that he sighed
often on his road thence to Jötunheim; but is it
not always thus that wisdom and strength come
to us weeping.</p>

<h3><a name="I_IV_THE_CHILDREN" id="I_IV_THE_CHILDREN"></a>PART IV. THE CHILDREN OF LOKI.</h3>

<p>When, at length, Odin found himself in the land of
giants&mdash;frost giants, mountain giants, three-headed
and wolf-headed giants, monsters and iron witches
of every kind&mdash;he walked straight on, without
stopping to fight with any one of them, until he
came to the middle of Jörmungand's body. Then
he seized the monster, growing fearfully as he
was all the time, and threw him headlong into
the deep ocean. There Jörmungand still grew,
until, encircling the whole earth, he found that
his tail was growing down his throat, after which
he lay quite still, binding himself together;
and neither Odin nor any one else has been<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" id="Page_68" title="[Pg 68]"></a>
able to move him thence. When Odin had thus
disposed of Jörmungand, henceforth called the
Midgard Serpent, he went on to the house of
Loki's wife. The door was thrown open, and the
wicked Witch-mother sat in the entrance, whilst on
one side crouched Fenrir, her ferocious wolf-son,
and on the other stood Hela, most terrible of
monsters and women. A crowd of giants strode
after Odin, curious to obtain a glance of Loki's
strange children before they should be sent away.
At Fenrir and the Witch-mother they stared with
great eyes, joyfully and savagely glittering; but
when he looked at Hela each giant became as
pale as new snow, and cold with terror as a mountain
of ice. Pale, cold, frozen, they never moved again;
but a rugged chain of rocks stood behind Odin, and
he looked on fearless and unchilled.</p>

<p>"Strange daughter of Loki," he said, speaking to
Hela, "you have the head of a queen, proud forehead,
and large, imperial eyes; but your heart is
pulseless, and your cruel arms kill what they
embrace. Without doubt you have somewhere a
kingdom; not where the sun shines, and men<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" id="Page_69" title="[Pg 69]"></a>
breathe the free air, but down below in infinite
depths, where bodiless spirits wander, and the cast-off
corpses are cold."</p>

<p>Then Odin pointed downwards towards Niflheim,
and Hela sank right through the earth, downward,
downward, to that abyss of abysses, where she
ruled over spectres, and made for herself a home
called Helheim, nine lengthy kingdoms wide and
deep.</p>

<p>After this, Odin desired Fenrir to follow him,
promising that if he became tractable and obedient,
and exchanged his ferocity for courage, he should
not be banished as his brother and sister had been.
So Fenrir followed, and Odin led the way out of
Jötunheim, across the ocean, over the earth, until
he came to the heavenly hills, which held up the
southern sky tenderly in their glittering arms.
There, half on the mountain-top and half in air,
sat Heimdall, guardian of the tremulous bridge
Bifröst, that arches from earth to heaven.</p>

<p>Heimdall was a tall, white Van, with golden teeth,
and a wonderful horn, called the Giallar Horn, which
he generally kept hidden under the tree Yggdrasil;<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" id="Page_70" title="[Pg 70]"></a>
but when he blew it the sound went out into all
worlds.</p>

<p>Now, Odin had never been introduced to Heimdall&mdash;had
never even seen him before; but he
did not pass him by without speaking on that
account. On the contrary, being altogether much
struck by his appearance, he could not refrain
from asking him a few questions. First, he requested
to know whom he had the pleasure of
addressing; secondly, who his parents were, and
what his education had been; and thirdly, how
he explained his present circumstances and occupation.</p>

<p>"My name is Heimdall," answered the guardian
of Bifröst, "and the son of nine sisters am I.
Born in the beginning of time, at the boundaries
of the earth, I was fed on the strength of the earth
and the cold sea. My training, moreover, was so
perfect, that I now need no more sleep than a
bird. I can see for a hundred miles around me
as well by night as by day; I can hear the grass
growing and the wool on the backs of sheep. I
can blow mightily my horn Giallar, and I for ever<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" id="Page_71" title="[Pg 71]"></a>
guard the tremulous bridge-head against monsters,
giants, iron witches, and dwarfs."</p>

<p>Then asked Odin, gravely, "Is it also forbidden to
the Æsir to pass this way, Heimdall? Must you
guard Bifröst, also, against them?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly not," answered Heimdall. "All
Æsir and heroes are free to tread its trembling,
many-coloured pavement, and they will do well to
tread it, for above the arch's summit I know that
the Urda fountain springs; rises, and falls, in a
perpetual glitter, and by its sacred waters the
Nornir dwell&mdash;those three mysterious, mighty
maidens, through whose cold fingers run the golden
threads of Time."</p>

<p>"Enough, Heimdall," answered Odin. "Tomorrow
we will come."</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" id="Page_72" title="[Pg 72]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="I_V_BIFROST" id="I_V_BIFROST"></a>PART V. BIFRÖST, URDA, AND THE NORNS.</h3>

<p>Odin departed from Heimdall, and went on his
way, Fenrir obediently following, though not now
much noticed by his captor, who pondered over the
new wonders of which he had heard. "Bifröst,
Urda, and the Norns&mdash;what can they mean?"</p>

<p>Thus pondering and wondering he went, ascended
Asgard's Hill, walked through the golden
gates of the City into the palace of Gladsheim, and
into the hall Valhalla, where, just then, the Æsir
and Asyniur<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> were assembled at their evening meal.
Odin sat down to the table without speaking, and,
still absent and meditative, proceeded to carve the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" id="Page_73" title="[Pg 73]"></a>
great boar, Sæhrimnir, which every evening eaten,
was every morning whole again. No one thought of
disturbing him by asking any questions, for they
saw that something was on his mind, and the Æsir
were well-bred. It is probable, therefore, that the
supper would have been concluded in perfect
silence if Fenrir had not poked his nose in at the
doorway, just opposite to the seat of the lovely
Freyja. She, genius of beauty as she was, and
who had never in her whole life seen even the
shadow of a wolf, covered her face with her hands,
and screamed a little, which caused all the Æsir
to start and turn round, in order to see what was
the matter. But Odin directed a reproving glance
at the ill-mannered Fenrir, and then gave orders
that the wolf should be fed; "after which," concluded
he, "I will relate my adventures to the
assembled Æsir."</p>

<p>"That is all very well, Asa Odin," answered
Frey; "but who, let me ask, is to undertake the
office of feeding yon hideous and unmannerly
animal?"</p>

<p>"That will I, joyfully," cried Tyr, who liked<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" id="Page_74" title="[Pg 74]"></a>
nothing better than an adventure; and then, seizing
a plate of meat from the table, he ran out of the
hall, followed by Fenrir, who howled, and sniffed,
and jumped up at him in a most impatient, un-Æsir-like
manner.</p>

<p>After the wolf was gone Freyja looked up again,
and when Tyr was seated once more, Odin began.
He told them of everything that he had seen, and
done, and suffered; and, at last, of Heimdall, that
strange white Van, who sat upon the heavenly
hills, and spoke of Bifröst, and Urda, and the
Norns. The Æsir were very silent whilst Odin
spoke to them, and were deeply and strangely
moved by this conclusion to his discourse.</p>

<p>"The Norns," repeated Frigga, "the Fountain
of Urd, the golden threads of time! Let us go,
my children," she said, rising from the table, "let
us go and look at these things."</p>

<p>But Odin advised that they should wait until
the next day, as the journey to Bifröst and
back again could easily be accomplished in a
single morning.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next day the Æsir and Asyniur all<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" id="Page_75" title="[Pg 75]"></a>
rose with the sun, and prepared to set forth. Niörd
came from Noatun, the mild sea-coast, which he had
made his home, and with continual gentle puffings
out of his wide, breezy mouth, he made their
journey to Bifröst so easy and pleasant, that they
all felt a little sorry when they caught the first
glitter of Heimdall's golden teeth. But Heimdall
was glad to see them; glad, at least, for their
sakes. He thought it would be so good for them
to go and see the Norns. As far as he himself
was concerned he never felt dull alone. On the top
of those bright hills how many meditations he had!
Looking far and wide over the earth how much he
saw and heard!</p>

<p>"Come already!" said Heimdall to the Æsir,
stretching out his long, white hands to welcome
them; "come already! Ah! this is Niörd's doing.
How do you do, cousin," said he; for Niörd and
Heimdall were related.</p>

<p>"How sweet and fresh it is up here!" remarked
Frigga, looking all round, and feeling that it would
be polite to say something. "You are very happy,
Sir," continued she, "in having always such fine<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" id="Page_76" title="[Pg 76]"></a>
scenery about you, and in being the guardian of
such a bridge."</p>

<p>And in truth Frigga might well say "such a
bridge;" for the like of it was never seen on the
ground. Trembling and glittering it swung across
the sky, up from the top of the mountain to
the clouds, and down again into the distant sea.</p>

<p>"Bifröst! Bifröst!" exclaimed the Æsir, wonderingly;
and Heimdall was pleased at their surprise.</p>

<p>"At the arch's highest point," said he, pointing
upward, "rises that fountain of which I spoke.
Do you wish to see it to-day?"</p>

<p>"That do we, indeed," cried all the Æsir in a
breath. "Quick, Heimdall, and unlock the bridge's
golden gate."</p>

<p>Then Heimdall took all his keys out, and fitted
them into the diamond lock till he found the right
one, and the gate flew open with a sound at the
same time sad and cheerful, like the dripping
of leaves after a thunder-shower.</p>

<p>The Æsir pressed in; but, as they passed him,
Heimdall laid his hand upon Thor's shoulder, and
said "I am very sorry, Thor; but it cannot be<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" id="Page_77" title="[Pg 77]"></a>
helped. You must go to the fountain alone by
another way; for you are so strong and heavy,
that if you were to put your foot on Bifröst, either
it would tremble in pieces beneath your weight,
or take fire from the friction of your iron heels.
Yonder, however, are two river-clouds, called Körmt
and Ermt, through which you can wade to the
Sacred Urd, and you will assuredly reach it in
time, though the waters of the clouds are strong
and deep."</p>

<p>At the words of Heimdall Thor fell back from
the bridge's head, vexed and sorrowful. "Am I
to be sent away, then, and have to do disagreeable
things," said he, "just because I am so strong?
After all, what are Urda and the Norns to me,
and Körmt and Ermt? I will go back to Asgard
again."</p>

<p>"Nay, Thor," said Odin, "I pray you, do not
anything so foolish. Think again, I beseech you,
what it is that we are going to see and hear.
Körmt and Ermt lie before you, as Bifröst before
us. It is yonder, above both, that we go. Neither
can it much matter, Thor, whether we reach<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" id="Page_78" title="[Pg 78]"></a>
the Fountain of Urd over Bifröst or through the
cloud."</p>

<p>Then Thor blushed with shame at his own
weakness, which had made him regret his strength;
and, without any more grumbling or hanging
back, he plunged into the dreadful river-clouds,
whose dark vapours closed around him and covered
him. He was hidden from sight, and
the Æsir went on their way over the glittering
bridge.</p>

<p>Daintily and airily they trod over it; they swung
themselves up the swinging arch; they reached its
summit on a pale, bright cloud. Thor was there
already waiting for them, drenched and weary,
but cheerful and bold. Then, all together, they
knocked at the door of the pale, bright cloud; it
blew open, and they passed in. Oh! then what
did they see! Looking up to an infinite height
through the purple air, they saw towering above
them Yggdrasil's fairest branches, leafy and of
a tender green, which also stretched far and wide;
but, though they looked long, the Æsir could distinguish
no topmost bough, and it almost seemed<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" id="Page_79" title="[Pg 79]"></a>
to them that, from somewhere up above, this mighty
earth-tree must draw another root, so firmly and
so tall it grew. On one side stood the Palace of
the Norns, which was so bright that it almost
blinded them to look at it, and on the other the
Urda fountain plashed its cool waters&mdash;rising, falling,
glittering, as nothing ever glitters on this side
the clouds. Two ancient swans swam under the
fount, and around it sat Three. Ah! how shall I
describe them&mdash;Urd, Verdandi, Skuld. They were
mighty, they were wilful, and one was veiled.
Sitting upon the Doomstead, they watched the
water as it rose and fell, and passed golden threads
from one to another. Verdandi plucked them
with busy fingers from Skuld's reluctant hand,
and wove them in and out quickly, almost carelessly;
for some she tore and blemished, and
some she cruelly spoiled. Then Urd took the
woof away from her, smoothed its rough places,
and covered up some of the torn, gaping holes;
but she hid away many of the bright parts, too,
and then rolled it all round her great roller,
Oblivion, which grew thicker and heavier every<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" id="Page_80" title="[Pg 80]"></a>
moment. And so they went on, Verdandi drawing
from Skuld, and Urd from Verdandi; but
whence Skuld drew her separate bright threads
no one could see. She never seemed to reach
the end of them, and neither of the sisters ever
stopped or grew weary of her work.</p>

<p>The Æsir stood apart watching, and it was a
great sight. They looked in the face of Urd,
and fed on wisdom; they studied the countenance
of Verdandi, and drank bitter strength; they
glanced through the veil of Skuld, and tasted
hope. At length, with full hearts, they stole away
silently, one by one, out by the pale, open door,
re-crossed the bridge, and stood once more by
the side of Heimdall on the heavenly hills; then
they went home again. Nobody spoke as they
went; but ever afterwards it was an understood
thing that the Æsir should fare to the Doomstead
of the Nornir once in every day.</p>

<h3><a name="I_VI_ODHAERIR" id="I_VI_ODHAERIR"></a>PART VI. ODHÆRIR.</h3>

<p>Now upon a day it happened that Odin sat silent
by the Well of Urd, and in the evening he mounted
Air Throne with a troubled mind. Allfather could
see into Dwarf Home from his high place, as well
as over man's world; his keen eye pierced, also, the
mountains and darkness of Jötunheim.</p>

<p>On this evening, a tear, the fate-sisters' gift, swam
across his vision, and&mdash;behold, is that an answering
tear which he sees down there in Dwarf Home, large,
luminous, golden, in the dark heart of the earth?
"Can dwarfs weep?" exclaimed Allfather, surprised
as he looked a second and a third time, and went on
looking. Fialar and Galar, the cunning dwarfs who<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" id="Page_82" title="[Pg 82]"></a>
had killed Kvasir, were kneeling beside the tear.
"Is it theirs?" said Allfather again, "and do they
repent?" No; it was not a tear; Odin knew
it at last. More precious still, it was Kvasir's
blood&mdash;golden mead now, because of the honey-drops
from Earth's thousand bees and flowers which
these thoughtless mischief-schemers, but wonder
workers, had poured into it. "It is three," said
Odin, "three precious draughts!&mdash;Odhærir is its name&mdash;and
now the dwarfs will drink it, and the life and
the light, and the sweetness of the world will be spilt,
and the heart of the world will die!" But the dwarfs
did not drink it; they could only sip it a little, just
a drop or two at a time. The Father of Hosts
watched how they were amusing themselves.</p>

<p>Fialar and Galar, and a whole army of the little
blackfaced, crooked-limbed creatures, were tilting the
big jars over to one side, whilst first one, and then
another, sucked the skim of their golden sweetness,
smacking their lips after it, grinning horribly,
leaping up into the air with strange gestures;
falling backwards with shut eyes some of
them, as if asleep; tearing at the earth and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" id="Page_83" title="[Pg 83]"></a>
the stones of their cavern homes others, like
wild beasts; rolling forth beautiful, senseless, terrible
words.</p>

<p>It was Fialar and Galar who did that; and behold,
in a little while, one after another, the dwarfs gathered
round them as they spoke, and listened, open-mouthed,
with clenched fists, stamping, and roaring applause
until at last they seized the weapons that lay
near, cocked their earth caps, each alit with
a coloured star, and marched in warlike fashion,
led on by Fialar and Galar, straight up through
their cavernous ways, to Manheim, and across
it into the Frozen Land.</p>

<p>Giant <span class="sic" title="[sic]">Vafthrûdnir</span>, that "Ancient Talker," he who
sits ever in his Hall weaving new and intricate questions
for the gods, saw them; and looking up towards
the brooding heavens, he exchanged glances with
the Father of Hosts. But the dwarfs did not come
near <span class="sic" title="[sic]">Vafthrüdnir's</span> Halls; they never looked aside at
him, nor up to the Air Throne of the Asa; only
rushed heedlessly on till they stumbled over the Giant
Gilling, who was taking a nap upon the green bank
of Ifing. Ifing looks a lazy stream; one can<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" id="Page_84" title="[Pg 84]"></a>
hardly see at first sight that it flows at all; but it
flows, and flows quietly, unceasingly, and is so
deep that neither god nor giant has ever yet been
able to fathom it. It is, in fact, that stream which
divides for ever the Jötuns from the Gods, and of it
Odin himself once said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Open shall it run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout all time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that stream no ice shall be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So the dwarfs found Gilling asleep; they knew
how deep Ifing was, they knew that if they could
once roll the giant Gilling in there he would never
get out again, and then they should have done
something worth speaking about.</p>

<p>"I have killed a giant," each dwarf might say,
and, who knows, even the Æsir might begin to
feel a little afraid of them.</p>

<p>"It all comes from drinking Kvasir's blood," they
said, and then with their thousand little swords and
spears, and sticks and stones, they worked away
until they had plunged the sleeping giant into the
stream. Allfather's piercing eye saw it all, and
how the silly dwarfs jumped and danced about<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" id="Page_85" title="[Pg 85]"></a>
afterwards, and praised themselves, and defied the
whole world, gods, giants and men.</p>

<p>"It is not for us," they said, "any more to run
away before Skinfaxi the shining horse that draws
day over humankind, whose mane sheds light
instead of dew; we will dance before him and
crown ourselves with gold, as the gods and as men
do every morning.<span class="corr" title='added: "'>"</span></p>

<p>But, in the midst of all their gleeful folly, the
ground they stood upon began to shake under
them, and an enormous darkness grew between
them and the sky. Then the dwarfs stopped their
rejoicing as if a spell had fallen upon them, dropping
their weapons, huddling close to one another, cowering,
whispering. Giant Suttung, son of that Gilling
whom they had just slain, was coming upon them
in great fury to avenge his father's death. They
were dreadfully frightened; Giant Gilling asleep
had been easy to manage, but a giant awake, a
giant angry&mdash;they were not the same dwarfs that
they had seemed half an hour ago&mdash;and so it
happened that they quite easily let Suttung carry
them all off to a low rock in the sea which was<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" id="Page_86" title="[Pg 86]"></a>
dry just then, but would be washed over by the
morning tide. "There you are," said Suttung as he
threw them all down upon the rock, "and there you
shall stay until the hungry grey wave comes." "But
then we shall be drowned," they all screeched at
once, and the seamews started from their nests
ashore and swooped round the lonely rock, and
screeched as well. Suttung strode back to the
shore and sat on the high rocks over the
seamews' nests, and poked his fingers into the nests
and played with the grey-winged birds, and paddled
his feet in the breakers, and laughed and echoed
the dwarfs and the seamews. "Drowned, drowned,
yes, then you will be drowned." Then the dwarfs
whispered together and consulted, they all talked
at once, and every one of them said a different
thing, for they were in fact a little intoxicated still
by the sips they had taken of Odhærir. At last
Fialar and Galar said the same same thing over
so often that the others began to listen to them.
"The sky is getting quite grey," they said, "and the
stars are going out, and Skinfaxi is coming, and
the waves are gathering and gathering and gathering;<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" id="Page_87" title="[Pg 87]"></a>
hoarse are the voices of the Seaking's daughters;
but why do we all sit chattering here instead of
getting away as we might easily do if we did but
bribe the giant Suttung with a gift." "Yes, yes,
yes," shouted the silly little people, "shall we give
him our cap jewels, or our swords, or our pick-axes,
or our lanterns, or shall we promise to make him
a necklace out of the fire of the sun and the flowers
of the earth, or shall we build him a ship of ships?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:327px">
<a name="ILLU_GIANT_SUTTUNG" id="ILLU_GIANT_SUTTUNG"></a>
<img src="images/i086.jpg" width="327" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Giant Suttung and the dwarfs.</div>
</div>

<p>"Nonsense," said Fialar and Galar; "How should
a giant care for such things as these? Our swords
could not help him; he does not want pick-axes
nor lanterns who lives amongst the mountain snows,
nor ships who can stride across the sea, nor necklaces&mdash;Bah!
A giant loves life, he drinks blood,
he is greedy besides and longs to taste the gold
mead of the gods."</p>

<p>Then all the dwarfs shouted together, "Let us
give him our gold mead, our wondrous drink,
Odhærir, our Kvasir's blood in the three stone jars."</p>

<p>Odin heard from Air Throne's blue deep. He
brooded over the scene. "The sweetness, and the
life, and the light of the world, then," he said, "are to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" id="Page_88" title="[Pg 88]"></a>
satiate a giant's greediness of food and blood"&mdash;and it
was for mankind that he became Terror in the trembling
Height. Allfather feared nothing for the gods at
that time: could he not pierce into Jötunheim, and
Svartheim, and Manheim alike? Suttung heard also
from the Rock.&mdash;"And what may this Odhærir be worth
that you boast of so much?" he shouted to the dwarfs.
"Wisdom, and labour, and fire, and life, and love," said
the dwarfs. "Tut, tut, tut!" answered Suttung.
"Does it taste well?" "Honey and wine; like the
blood of a God and the milk of the Earth." Then
Suttung got up slowly from the rock, pressing it down
with his hands into two little dells as he rose, and
strode to the island, from which he took up all the
dwarfs at a grasp&mdash;they clinging to his fists and wrists
like needles to a magnet; and, with one swoop, threw
them ashore just as the hungry waves began to lap and
wash about the dwarf's-peril. So the dwarfs jumped,
and leaped, and laughed, and sang, and chattered
again, and ran on before Suttung, to fetch him the
golden mead, Odhærir. Three big stone jars, all full.
The Spirit-mover, the Peace-offer, the Peace-kiss.
Suttung lifted the lids, and looked into the jars. "It<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" id="Page_89" title="[Pg 89]"></a>
doesn't look much," he said; "and, after all, I don't
know that I shall care to taste it; but I'll take the
jars home to my daughter Gunnlöd, and they will
make a pretty treasure for her to keep."</p>

<p>Odin brooded over the scene. It was a grey winter's
morning in Jötunheim&mdash;ice over all the rivers,
snow upon the mountains, rime-writing across the
woods, weird hoar letters straggling over the bare
branches of the trees, writing such as giants and gods
can read, but men see it only as pearl-drops of the
cold. Suttung could read it well enough as he
trudged along to his Mountain Home&mdash;better than
he had ever read it before; for was he not bearing
upon his shoulders the wondrous Kvasir's life-giving
blood, Odhærir. Odin read it, "This is ominous,
Odin; this is dark. Shall the gold mead be
made captive in frozen halls?" For behold,
the life-tear becomes dark in the dark land, as
Suttung's huge door opened to let him in, him
and his treasure, and then closed upon them both,
Suttung gave the mead to his daughter Gunnlöd to
keep, to guard it well, and&mdash;the heart of Manheim
trembled, it was empty and cold. Then Odin looked<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" id="Page_90" title="[Pg 90]"></a>
north and south and east and west, over the whole
world. "Come to me," he said, and two swift-winged
ravens flew towards him. It seemed as if they came
out of nothing; for in a moment they were not there
and they were there. Their names were Hugin and
Munin, and they came from the ends of the earth,
where Odin sent them every morning. Every evening
he was wont to say of them,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"I fear me for Hugin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest he come not back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But much more for Munin."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Yet they never failed to come back, both of them, at
the dim hour in which they recounted to the Father
of Hosts the history of the day that was past, and the
hope of the day that was to come. On this evening,
Munin's song was so terrible that only the strength
of a god could possibly have endured to its end.
Hugin struck another note, profounder and sweet.
Then said Odin, when cadence after cadence had
filled his ears, and he had descended from Air
Throne, "Night is the time for new counsels; let
each one reflect until the morrow who is able to give
advice helpful to the Æsir."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" id="Page_91" title="[Pg 91]"></a></p>

<p>But when the jewelled horse ran up along the sky,
from whence his mane shed light over the whole
world, when giants and giantesses, and ghosts and
dwarfs crouched beneath Yggdrasil's outer Root, when
Heimdall ran up Bifrost and blew mightily his horn in
Heaven's height, there was only one found who gave
counsel to Odin, and that was Odin himself. "Odhærir,"
he said, "which is a god-gift, must come up to
men's earthly dwellings. Go forth, Hugin, go forth,
Munin," said the Asa, and he also went forth alone,
none knowing where he went, nor how.</p>

<p>So Odin journeyed for a long, long while towards
Suttung's Hall, across the windy, wintry ways of Jötunheim,
seeing well before him the yellow mead as he
went, through rocks, and woods, and rivers, and
through night itself, until at last it happened that
Odin came into a meadow upon a summer morning
in Giant Land. Nine slaves were mowing in the
meadow, whetting some old rusty scythes which they
had, working heavily, for they were senseless fellows,
and the summer day grew faster upon them than their
labour grew to completion. "You seem heavy-hearted,"
said Odin to the thralls; and they began to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" id="Page_92" title="[Pg 92]"></a>
explain to him how rusty and old their scythes were,
and that they had no whetstone to sharpen them with.
Upon this Odin offered to whet their scythes for them
with his whetstone: and no sooner had he done so than
the scythes became so sharp that they could have cut
stones as easily as grass. Instead of mowing, however,
the thralls began to clamour round Odin, beseeching
him to give his whetstone to them. "Give it to
me! give it to me: give it to me!" cried one and
another; and all the time Odin stood quietly amongst
them, throwing his whetstone up in the air, and
catching it as it fell. Then the thralls tried if they
could catch it, leaning stupidly across one another,
with their scythes in their hands. Was Allfather
surprised at what happened next? He could
hardly have been that; but he was sorry when,
looking down as the whetstone fell, he saw all the
thralls lying dead at his feet, killed by each other's
sharpened weapons. "This is an Evil Land," said
Odin, as he looked down on the dead thralls, "and
I am a bringer of evil into it."</p>

<p>So he journeyed on till he came to the house of
Suttung's brother, Baugi. Odin asked Baugi to give<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" id="Page_93" title="[Pg 93]"></a>
him a night's lodging, and Baugi, who knew no more
than the thralls had done who this traveller was,
consented, and began to talk to Odin of the trouble
he was in. "This is hay harvest," he said, "as you
must have seen, walking here through the meadows;
and I have a mighty field to gather in, but how to
do it puzzles me, because my nine slaves whom I
sent out sound and well this morning, all fell dead
about the middle of the day. How they managed
it, I can't imagine, and it puts me out sadly, for
summer days don't last long in Jötunheim."
"Well," said Odin, "I'm not a bad hand at mowing,
and I don't mind undertaking to do the work of nine
thralls for you, Baugi, for a certain reward you may
give me, if you will." "What is that?" inquired
Baugi, eagerly. "A draught of that golden mead,
Odhærir, which Suttung obtained from the dwarfs, and
which his daughter Gunnlöd keeps for him." "Oh!
that," said Baugi, "isn't so good as my homebrewed
for a thirsty mower; but you shall have it. It is a
bargain between us." So Odin worked for Baugi the
whole summer through with the labour of nine instead
of with the labour of one; and when the last field was<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" id="Page_94" title="[Pg 94]"></a>
reaped, and wintry mists were gathering, the god and
the giant began to talk over their bargain again.
"We will come together to Suttung's house," said
Baugi, "and my brother shall give you the draught
which you desire so much." But when the two came
to Suttung's house, and asked him for the mead,
Suttung was exceedingly angry, and would not hear a
word about it from either of them. "You don't
drink it yourself, brother," pleaded Baugi, "although
you might do so every day if you liked, without asking
anybody's leave, or doing one stroke of work for it,
whilst this man has toiled night and day for nine
months that he might taste it only once." "Odhærir
is for us giants, nevertheless," answered Suttung, "and
well does my daughter Gunnlöd guard it from dwarfs
and from men, from spectres, from Asyniur, and from
Æsir. Have I not sworn that so it shall be guarded
by all the snows of Jötunheim, and by the stormy
waves, and by the yawning chasm of the abyss."
Then Baugi knew that nothing more was to be said,
and he advised Odin to go back with him at once,
and drink beer. But Odin was not to be turned
from his purpose so easily. "You promised me a<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" id="Page_95" title="[Pg 95]"></a>
draught of the gold mead, Baugi," he said, "and I
can see it through the rock in its three treasure jars;
sit down by me and look through the rock till
you can see it too." So Odin and Baugi sat down
together, and pierced the rock with their glances all
that day until they had made a small hole in it; and at
night, when Suttung was asleep, and when Gunnlöd
was asleep, and whilst the gold mead shone steadily
in the heart of the cave, Odin looked up towards
Asgard, and said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Little get I here by silence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a well-assumed form I will make good use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For few things fail the wise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And then this strong wise Asa picked up from the
ground the little, mean, wriggling form of a worm
and put it on and crept noiselessly into the hole
which he and Baugi had made,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"The giant's ways are under me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giant's ways are over me,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">said Odin as he wriggled through the stone, but
when he had got quite through to the inner side,
to Gunnlöd's room, Odin took his proper form again.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" id="Page_96" title="[Pg 96]"></a></p>

<p>"I see her upon her golden seat," he said as he
looked upon the sleeping Gunnlöd where she lay,
and Odin was surprised to see a giant-maid so
beautiful. Surprised and sorry. "For I must
leave her weeping," he mused. "How shall she
not weep, defrauded of her treasure in an Evil
Land." And Odin loved and pitied the beautiful
maiden so much, that he would have returned
to Asgard without the mead had that
been possible. Alas for Gunnlöd, it was less
possible than ever since Allfather had seen her.
For Gunnlöd awoke in the light of Odin's glance
and trembled, she did not know why, she did not
know at first that he was an Asa, but, when he
asked her for her treasure she could not keep it
from him, she could not have kept anything from
him. She rose from her golden couch, her blue
eyes melted into the tenderness of a summer sky,
she undid the bars and bolts and coverings of
Odhærir, which she had guarded so faithfully till
then, and knelt before Odin and stretched her
hands towards him and said, "Drink, for I think
you are a god."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" id="Page_97" title="[Pg 97]"></a></p>

<p>A draught, a draught, a long, deep draught, and
the spirit of the Asa was shaken through its height
and through its depth, and again a draught of
love flowing forth to the outermost, to the abysses,
and one draught again&mdash;peace&mdash;in rushing, still.</p>

<p>Why are you weeping so, Gunnlöd? Oh! Why
do you weep? Did you not give him your whole
treasure, "your fervent love, your whole soul;" you
kept nothing back, and Odhærir is for ever the
inheritance of the gods. The dwarfs sold it for their
lives, the giantess lost it of her love, gods win it
for the world.</p>

<p>"It is for the Æsir, it is for men," said Odin.
"It is Odin's booty, it is Odin's gift;" and immediately,
in haste to share it, the Asa spread eagle's
wings, and flew far up, away from the barren rock,
and the black, cold halls of Suttung, towards his
heavenly home. Alas for Gunnlöd! she has lost her
treasure and her Asa too. How cold the cavern is
now in which she sits! her light is gone out; she is
left alone; she is left weeping upon her golden throne.
But Odin soared upwards&mdash;flew on toward Asgard,
and the Æsir came crowding upon the city's jewelled<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" id="Page_98" title="[Pg 98]"></a>
walls to watch his approach. And soon they perceived
that two eagles were flying towards the city,
the second pursuing the first. The pursuing eagle
was Suttung, who, as soon as he found that his mead
was gone, and that Odin eagle-wise had escaped his
vengeance, spread also <em>his</em> eagle's wings, very strong
and very swift, in pursuit. Suttung appeared to gain
upon Odin. Frigga feared for her beloved. The
Asyniur and the Æsir watched breathlessly. Frost
giants and Storm giants came crowding up from the
deeps to see. "Does Odin return amongst the gods?"
they asked, "or will Suttung destroy him?" It was
not possible, however, that the struggle should end in
any way but one. The Divine bird dropped from the
height upon his Hall&mdash;the High One's Hall&mdash;and
then there burst from him such a flood of song that
the widest limits of Æsir Land were overflowed&mdash;some
sounds even spilt themselves upon the common
earth. "It is Poetry herself, it is Odin's booty, it is
Odin's gift. It is for the Æsir, it is for the Æsir,"
said a thousand and a thousand songs. "And for
men," answered Allfather, with his million ringing,
changing voices; "it is for men." "Such as have<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" id="Page_99" title="[Pg 99]"></a>
sufficient wit to make a right use of it," said Loki.
And this was the first discordant note that troubled
Asgard after Odin's return.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this tale, or rather in this arrangement of tales,
most of the chief gods are named, and one or two
of the myths concerning them are hinted at. The
sweet mixture made out of Kvasir's blood, and
given to the giant Suttung to keep, was called,
as we have seen, Odhærir. It was kept in three
jars, and though the name of it as a whole was
Odhærir, the portion in the second jar was also
called "Sohn," and that in the third jar "Bohn."
Odhærir is mentioned in two of the <i>Elder Edda</i>
Songs, and in the <i>Younger Edda</i> an account is
given of Odin bringing it up to Asgard. Neither
of the <i>Eddas</i>, it must be remarked, mentions the
banishment of the dwarfs and elves in connection
with Kvasir's death. The golden mead, Odhærir,
is supposed to signify poetry. The first syllable
of the name means mind and feeling. Odhærir,
spirit mover. "Sohn" means reconciliation, or<a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" id="Page_100" title="[Pg 100]"></a>
the <em>offer</em> of peace. "Bohn" means the <em>acceptance</em>
of peace,&mdash;these two latter names referring to
the origin of Kvasir, who was created out of the
peace made between the Æsir and the Vanir.</p>

<p>Simrock thinks that "Kvasir," meaning fermentation,
implies the excitement necessary to poetry;
that Odin, labouring for a draught of the precious
mead, suggests that poetry can only be possessed
through labour, and that his receiving it from
the beautiful Gunnlöd, expresses it as the gift and
crown of love. Odin drinking it three times signifies
the <em>intensity</em> through which poetry lives,&mdash;it is intoxication.
Odin appears to have felt very wise after
his three draughts; for he is made to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Potent songs I learned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a draught obtained<br /></span>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" id="Page_101" title="[Pg 101]"></a>
One of the <i>Edda</i> songs is called the "High
One's Lay." So we may conclude it was inspired
by Suttung's mead. One or two of the strophes
are worth quoting, just to show what the lay
is like. The following are selected from different
places and have no connection with one another.</p>

</div></div>

<p>We often read of Odin disguising himself, sometimes
in animal, more frequently in human form. He<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" id="Page_103" title="[Pg 103]"></a>
wanders about the world, and very curious stories
are told about his adventures. Sometimes he asks
his wife's leave before setting off,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Counsel thou me now, Frigg!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I long to go<br /></span>

<p>And Frigg answers,&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">When thou, father of men! shalt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold converse with the giant."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Odin was not obliged to take long journeys
himself when he wanted to know what was going on
in the world,&mdash;he had, as we have seen, two
messengers whom he sent out daily,&mdash;the Ravens
Hugin and Munin, thought and memory,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Hugin and Munin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each dawn take their flight<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But much more for Munin."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Perhaps because of Munin being memory he was
expected to fail first.</p>

<p>Odin looking over into Niflheim, is thus alluded to
in an old song. The god is made to say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"I know that I hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a wind-rocked tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine whole nights.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To runes applied myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wailing learnt them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fell down thence."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next strophe tells how he got the draught of
the precious mead. In this myth, it seems as if Odin
hung upon Yggdrassil. Simrock mentions a singular
little German tale which may possibly have some
connection with it, and has evidently an Eastern
origin. "A man," it says, "in danger of falling into a
brook, held fast with one hand to a shrub whilst his
feet rested on a small piece of grass. In this
predicament, he saw two mice (day and night)
gnawing at the root of the shrub, and the grass<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" id="Page_105" title="[Pg 105]"></a>
undermined by four worm heads. Then a dragon
appeared and opened his mouth to swallow him up,
whilst an elephant reached his trunk towards him.
At the same time he seized with eager mouth some
honey which dropt from the tree." Simrock says
that the eating of the honey is like people being
occupied with frivolity whilst the world-battle goes
on, but may not the story possibly have a little to do
with Odin and Yggdrassil and Odhærir.</p>

<p>We heard before that Odin was connected with
Air. We see him here on his High Throne looking
over all worlds, wandering over the earth, piercing
even to the deep, giving his eye to Mimer for
wisdom&mdash;consequently having only one eye, one Sun
in Heaven&mdash;some suppose that the pledged eye
means the setting of the Sun nightly. Mimer, who
guards the well, means the remembrance of the origin
of things which was water&mdash;the strange waves that
flowed into Ginnungagap. An odd story is told of
Mimer, who was originally a giant though received
by the Æsir, viz., that he was sent as a hostage to
the Vanir, who cut off his head and sent it back to
Odin. The head remained so wise that the father of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" id="Page_106" title="[Pg 106]"></a>
the gods used to consult it on all important occasions;
as the lay says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Odin speaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Mim's head."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Heimdall, guardian of the Bridge (whose exact
name was "trembling rest") was perhaps the most
important of the Vanir. He is represented in one
old lay as travelling about the world by himself,
which is a sure sign that he was originally a very
great god indeed. Upon this journey he became the
father of the three races of men, the Thralls, the
Karls and the Jarls. The way in which these three
races are compared with one another is very curious.</p>

<p>The Thralls are described with "shrivelled skin,
knotty knuckles, thick fingers, hideous faces, curved
backs and protruding heels, they are made to erect
fences, manure fields, tend swine, keep goats and dig
turf." The Karls' children are said to be clothed in
linen, to be ruddy headed and have twinkling eyes,
and they grow up to "tame oxen, make ploughs,
build houses, make carts and farm;" but the favoured,
useless Jarls, "Light of hair, bright cheeks, eyes<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" id="Page_107" title="[Pg 107]"></a>
piercing as a serpent's," grow up to "shake the shield,
to brandish spears,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Horses to ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dogs to slip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swords to draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swimming to practise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Heimdall keeps the bridge alike from thunder god
and frost giants, but at Ragnarök, the swarthy god
Surtur, who lives on the borders of Muspellheim,
will ride over it and shatter it to pieces. Heimdall's
horn is mentioned,&mdash;this is supposed to mean the
crescent moon, and Mimer's drinking horn also
means the moon. Later, when the stories of the
gods had dwindled down into weird, unholy legends,
and Odin had sunk into the wild Huntsman, the
crescent moon was his horn. One of Heimdall's
names was Irmin, and this means "Shining." The
milky way is called Irmin strasse or Irmin's way,
and the wild hunt was supposed to go over the milky
way, which is also called Waldemar's way in
Denmark, and Waldemar is a common name of
hunters.</p>

<p>Loki and his children in these myths are evidently<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" id="Page_108" title="[Pg 108]"></a>
the destructive principle, either physically, or morally,
or both. Jörmungand and Fenrir are much alike.
Jörmungand means "the universal Wolf," and of
Fenrir it is said "he goes about revengeful, with
open jaws devouring all things." Hela had originally
another side to her character, but here as Loki's
daughter she has only the nature of his other children.</p>

<p>The myth about Loki finding the half-burnt heart
of a woman is said to be a very young one; and so
perhaps it is not worth considering the meaning of.</p>

<p>The god about whom, next to Odin, most stories
are told, is Thor. In some parts of the north he was
a more prominent object of worship even than Odin,
Norway and Iceland being especially devoted to his
service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now hear how Thor went to Jötunheim.</p>

<hr class="chapbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" id="Page_109" title="[Pg 109]"></a></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />
HOW THOR WENT TO JÖTUNHEIM.</h2>


<h3><a name="II_I_FROM_ASGARD" id="II_I_FROM_ASGARD"></a>PART I. FROM ASGARD TO UTGARD.</h3>

<p>Once on a time, Asa Thor and Loki set out
on a journey from Asgard to Jötunheim. They
travelled in Thor's chariot, drawn by two milk-white
goats. It was a somewhat cumbrous iron
chariot, and the wheels made a rumbling noise as
it moved, which sometimes startled the ladies of
Asgard, and made them tremble; but Thor liked
it, thought the noise sweeter than any music, and
was never so happy as when he was journeying in
it from one place to another.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" id="Page_110" title="[Pg 110]"></a></p>

<p>They travelled all day, and in the evening they
came to a countryman's house. It was a poor,
lonely place; but Thor descended from his chariot,
and determined to pass the night there. The
countryman, however, had no food in his house to
give these travellers; and Thor, who liked to feast
himself and make every one feast with him, was
obliged to kill his own two goats and serve them
up for supper. He invited the countryman and
his wife and children to sup with him; but before
they began to eat he made one request of them.</p>

<p>"Do not, on any account," he said, "break or
throw away any of the bones of the goats you are
going to eat for supper."</p>

<p>"I wonder why," said the peasant's son, Thialfi,
to his sister Roska. Roska could not think of
any reason, and <span class="sic" title="[sic]">by-and-bye</span> Thialfi happened to
have a very nice little bone given him with some
marrow in it. "Certainly there can be no harm
in my breaking just this one," he said to himself;
"it would be such a pity to lose the marrow;"
and as Asa Thor's head was turned another way,
he slyly broke the bone in two, sucked the marrow,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" id="Page_111" title="[Pg 111]"></a>
and then threw the pieces into the goats' skins,
where Thor had desired that all the bones might
be placed. I do not know whether Thialfi was
uneasy during the night about what he had done;
but in the morning he found out the reason of Asa
Thor's command, and received a lesson on "wondering
why," which he never forgot all his life after.</p>

<p>As soon as Asa Thor rose in the morning he
took his hammer, Miölnir, in his hand, and held it
over the goat-skins as they lay on the floor, whispering
runes the while. They were dead skins with
dry bones on them when he began to speak; but as
he said the last word, Thialfi, who was looking
curiously on, saw two live goats spring up and walk
towards the chariot, as fresh and well as when they
brought the chariot up to the door Thialfi hoped.
But no; one of the goats limped a little with his
hind leg, and Asa Thor saw it. His brow grew
dark as he looked, and for a minute Thialfi thought
he would run far, far into the forest, and never
come back again; but one look more at Asa Thor's
face, angry as it was, made him change his mind.
He thought of a better thing to do than running<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" id="Page_112" title="[Pg 112]"></a>
away. He came forward, threw himself at the
Asa's feet, and, confessing what he had done, begged
pardon for his disobedience. Thor listened, and
the displeased look passed away from his face.</p>

<p>"You have done wrong, Thialfi," he said, raising
him up; "but as you have confessed your fault so
bravely, instead of punishing you, I will take you
with me on my journey, and teach you myself the
lesson of obedience to the Æsir which is, I see,
wanted."</p>

<p>Roska chose to go with her brother, and from
that day Thor had two faithful servants, who followed
him wherever he went.</p>

<p>The chariot and goats were now left behind: but,
with Loki and his two new followers, Thor journeyed
on to the end of Manheim, over the sea, and
then on, on, on in the strange, barren, misty land of
Jötunheim, Sometimes they crossed great mountains;
sometimes they had to make their way among
torn and rugged rocks, which often, through the
mist, appeared to them to wear the forms of men,
and once for a whole day they traversed a thick and
tangled forest. In the evening of that day, being<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" id="Page_113" title="[Pg 113]"></a>
very much tired, they saw with pleasure that they
had come upon a spacious hall, of which the door, as
broad as the house itself, stood wide open.</p>

<p>"Here we may very comfortably lodge for the
night," said Thor; and they went in and looked
about them.</p>

<p>The house appeared to be perfectly empty; there
was a wide hall, and five smaller rooms opening into
it. They were, however, too tired to examine it carefully,
and as no inhabitants made their appearance,
they ate their supper in the hall, and lay down to
sleep. But they had not rested long before they
were disturbed by strange noises, groanings, mutterings,
and snortings, louder than any animal that
they had ever seen in their lives could make. By-and-bye
the house began to shake from side to side,
and it seemed as if the very earth trembled. Thor
sprang up in haste, and ran to the open door; but,
though he looked earnestly into the starlit forest,
there was no enemy to be seen anywhere. Loki
and Thialfi, after groping about for a time, found
a sheltered chamber to the right, where they
thought they could finish their night's rest in safety;<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" id="Page_114" title="[Pg 114]"></a>
but Thor, with Miölnir in his hand, watched at
the door of the house all night. As soon as the day
dawned he went out into the forest, and there,
stretched on the ground close by the house, he saw
a strange, uncouth, gigantic shape of a man, out of
whose nostrils came a breath which swayed the trees
to their very tops. There was no need to wonder
any longer what the disturbing noises had been.
Thor fearlessly walked up to this strange monster
to have a better look at him; but at the sound of
his footsteps the giant-shape rose slowly, stood up
an immense height, and looked down upon Thor with
two great misty eyes, like blue mountain-lakes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:334px">
<a name="ILLU_GIANT_SKRYMIR" id="ILLU_GIANT_SKRYMIR"></a>
<img src="images/i115.jpg" width="334" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Giant Skrymir and Thor.</div>
</div>

<p>"Who are you?" said Thor, standing on tiptoe,
and stretching his neck to look up; "and why do
you make such a noise as to prevent your neighbours
from sleeping?"</p>

<p>"My name is Skrymir," said the giant sternly;
"I need not ask yours. You are the little Asa
Thor of Asgard; but pray, now, what have you
done with my glove?"</p>

<p>As he spoke he stooped down, and picked up
the hall where Thor and his companions had<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" id="Page_115" title="[Pg 115]"></a>
passed the night, and which, in truth, was nothing
more than his glove, the room where Loki and
Thialfi had slept being the thumb.</p>

<p>Thor rubbed his eyes, and felt as if he must
be dreaming. Rousing himself, however, he raised
Miölnir in his hand, and, trying to keep his eyes
fixed on the giant's face, which seemed to be
always changing, he said, "It is time that you
should know, Skrymir, that I am come to Jötunheim
to fight and conquer such evil giants as
you are, and, little as you think me, I am ready
to try my strength against yours."</p>

<p>"Try it, then," said the giant.</p>

<p>And Thor, without another word, threw Miölnir
at his head.</p>

<p>"Ah! Ah!" said the giant; "did a leaf touch me?"</p>

<p>Again Thor seized Miölnir, which always returned
to his hand, however far he cast it from him, and
threw it with all his force.</p>

<p>The giant put up his hand to his forehead. "I
think," he said, "that an acorn must have fallen on
my head."</p>

<p>A third time Thor struck a blow, the heaviest<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" id="Page_116" title="[Pg 116]"></a>
that ever fell from the hand of an Asa; but this
time the giant laughed out loud.</p>

<p>"There is surely a bird on that tree," he said,
"who has let a feather fall on my face."</p>

<p>Then, without taking any further notice of Thor,
he swung an immense wallet over his shoulder, and,
turning his back upon him, struck into a path that
led from the forest. When he had gone a little
way he looked round, his immense face appearing
less like a human countenance than some strange,
uncouthly-shaped stone toppling on a mountain
precipice.</p>

<p>"Ving-Thor,"<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> he said, "let me give you a piece
of good advice before I go. When you get to
Utgard don't make much of yourself. You think
me a tall man, but you have taller still to see; and
you yourself are a very little mannikin. Turn back
home whence you came, and be satisfied to have
learned something of yourself by your journey to
Jötunheim."</p>

<p>"Mannikin or not, <em>that</em> will I never do," shouted
Asa Thor after the giant. "We will meet again,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" id="Page_117" title="[Pg 117]"></a>
and something more will we learn, or teach each
other."</p>

<p>The giant, however, did not turn back to answer,
and Thor and his companions, after looking for
some time after him, resumed their journey. Before
the sun was quite high in the heavens they came
out of the forest, and at noon they found themselves
on a vast barren plain, where stood a great city,
whose walls of dark, rough stone were so high,
that Thor had to bend his head quite far back to
see the top of them. When they approached the
entrance of this city they found that the gates were
closed and barred; but the space between the bars
was so large that Thor passed through easily, and
his companions followed him. The streets of the
city were gloomy and still. They walked on for
some time without meeting any one; but at length
they came to a very high building, of which the
gates stood open.</p>

<p>"Let us go in and see what is going on here,"
said Thor; and they went.</p>

<p>After crossing the threshold they found themselves
in an immense banqueting hall. A table stretched<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" id="Page_118" title="[Pg 118]"></a>
from one end to the other of it; stone thrones stood
round the table, and on every throne sat a giant,
each one, as Thor glanced round, appearing more
grim, and cold, and stony than the rest. One
among them sat on a raised seat, and appeared to
be the chief; so to him Thor approached and paid
his greetings.</p>

<p>The giant chief just glanced at him, and, without
rising, said, in a somewhat careless manner, "It
is, I think, a foolish custom to tease tired travellers
with questions about their journey. I know without
asking that you, little fellow, are Asa Thor.
Perhaps, however, you may be in reality taller than
you appear; and as it is a rule here that no one
shall sit down to table till he has performed
some wonderful feat, let us hear what you and your
followers are famed for, and in what way you choose
to prove yourselves worthy to sit down in the company
of giants."</p>

<p>At this speech, Loki, who had entered the
hall cautiously behind Thor, pushed himself forward.</p>

<p>"The feat for which I am most famed," he said,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" id="Page_119" title="[Pg 119]"></a>
"is eating, and it is one which I am just now
inclined to perform with right good will. Put food
before me, and let me see if any of your followers
can <span class="sic" title="[sic]">despatch</span> it as quickly as I can."</p>

<p>"The feat you speak of is one by no means
to be despised," said the King, "and there is one
here who would be glad to try his powers against
yours. Let Logi," he said to one of his followers,
"be summoned to the hall."</p>

<p>At this, a tall, thin, yellow-faced man approached,
and a large trough of meat having been placed
in the middle of the hall, Loki sat to work at
one end, and Logi at the other, and they began to
eat. I hope <em>I</em> shall never see any one eat as they
ate; but the giants all turned their slow-moving
eyes to watch them, and in a few minutes they
met in the middle of the trough. It seemed, at
first, as if they had both eaten exactly the same
quantity; but, when the thing came to be examined
into, it was found that Loki had, indeed, eaten
up all the meat, but that Logi had also eaten the
bones and the trough. Then the giants nodded
their huge heads, and determined that Loki was<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" id="Page_120" title="[Pg 120]"></a>
conquered. The King now turned to Thialfi, and
asked what he could do.</p>

<p>"I was thought swift of foot among the youth
of my own country," answered Thialfi; "and I will,
if you please, try to run a race with any one here."</p>

<p>"You have chosen a noble sport, indeed," said
the King; "but you must be a good runner if you
could beat him with whom I shall match you."</p>

<p>Then he called a slender lad, Hugi by name, and
the whole company left the hall, and, going out by
an opposite gate to that by which Thor had entered,
they came out to an open space, which made a
noble race-ground. There the goal was fixed, and
Thialfi and Hugi started off together.</p>

<p>Thialfi ran fast&mdash;fast as the reindeer which hears
the wolves howling behind; but Hugi ran so much
faster that, passing the goal, he turned round, and
met Thialfi half-way in the course.</p>

<p>"Try again, Thialfi," cried the King; and Thialfi,
once more taking his place, flew along the
course with feet scarcely touching the ground&mdash;swiftly
as an eagle when, from his mountain-crag,
he swoops on his prey in the valley; but with all<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" id="Page_121" title="[Pg 121]"></a>
his running he was still a good bow-shot from the
goal when Hugi reached it.</p>

<p>"You are certainly a good runner," said the
King; "but if you mean to win you must do a
little better still than this; but perhaps you wish
to surprise us all the more this third time."</p>

<p>The third time, however, Thialfi was wearied, and
though he did his best, Hugi, having reached the
goal, turned and met him not far from the starting-point.</p>

<p>The giants again looked at each other, and
declared that there was no need of further trial, for
that Thialfi was conquered.</p>

<p>It was now Asa Thor's turn, and all the company
looked eagerly at him, while the Utgard King asked
by what wonderful feat he chose to distinguish
himself.</p>

<p>"I will try a drinking-match with any of you,"
Thor said, shortly; for, to tell the truth, he cared
not to perform anything very worthy in the company
in which he found himself.</p>

<p>King Utgard appeared pleased with this choice,
and when the giants had resumed their seats in<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" id="Page_122" title="[Pg 122]"></a>
the hall, he ordered one of his servants to bring
in his drinking-cup, called the "cup of penance,"
which it was his custom to make his guests drain
at a draught, if they had broken any of the
ancient rules of the society.</p>

<p>"There!" he said, handing it to Thor, "we
call it well drunk if a person empties it at a single
draught. Some, indeed, take two to it; but the
very puniest can manage it in three."</p>

<p>Thor looked into the cup; it appeared to him
long, but not so very large after all, and being
thirsty he put it to his lips, and thought to make
short work of it, and empty it at one good, hearty
pull. He drank, and put the cup down again;
but, instead of being empty, it was now just so
full that it could be moved without danger of
spilling.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! You are keeping all your strength
for the second pull I see," said Utgard, looking
in. Without answering, Thor lifted the cup again,
and drank with all his might till his breath
failed; but, when he put down the cup, the liquor
had only sunk down a little from the brim.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" id="Page_123" title="[Pg 123]"></a></p>

<p>"If you mean to take three draughts to it," said
Utgard, "you are really leaving yourself a very
unfair share for the last time. Look to yourself,
Ving-Thor; for, if you do not acquit yourself better
in other feats, we shall not think so much of you
here as they say the Æsir do in Asgard."</p>

<p>At this speech Thor felt angry, and, seizing the
cup again, he drank a third time, deeper and longer
than he had yet done; but, when he looked into
the cup, he saw that a very small part only of its
contents had disappeared. Wearied and disappointed
he put the cup down, and said he would
try no more to empty it.</p>

<p>"It is pretty plain," said the King, looking
round on the company, "that Asa Thor is by no
means the kind of man we always supposed him
to be."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Thor, "I am willing to try another
feat, and you yourselves shall choose what it shall
be."</p>

<p>"Well," said the King, "there is a game at
which our children are used to play. A short time
ago I dare not have named it to Asa Thor; but now<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" id="Page_124" title="[Pg 124]"></a>
I am curious to see how he will acquit himself
in it. It is merely to lift my cat from the ground&mdash;a
childish amusement truly."</p>

<p>As he spoke a large, grey cat sprang into the
hall, and Thor, stooping forward, put his hand
under it to lift it up. He tried gently at first;
but by degrees he put forth all his strength,
tugging and straining as he had never done before;
but the utmost he could do was to raise one of
the cat's paws a little way from the ground.</p>

<p>"It is just as I thought," said King Utgard,
looking round with a smile; "but we all are willing
to allow that the cat <em>is</em> large, and Thor but a
little fellow."</p>

<p>"Little as you think me," cried Thor, "who
is there who will dare to wrestle with me in my
anger?"</p>

<p>"In truth," said the King, "I don't think
there is any one here who would choose to wrestle
with you; but, if wrestle you must, I will call
in that old crone Elli. She has, in her time,
laid low many a better man than Asa Thor has
shown himself to be."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" id="Page_125" title="[Pg 125]"></a></p>

<p>The crone came. She was old, withered, and
toothless, and Thor shrank from the thought of
wrestling with her; but he had no choice. She
threw her arms round him, and drew him towards
the ground, and the harder he tried to free himself,
the tighter grew her grasp. They struggled long.
Thor strove bravely, but a strange feeling of weakness
and weariness came over him, and at length
he tottered and fell down on one knee before her.
At this sight all the giants laughed aloud, and
Utgard coming up, desired the old woman to
leave the hall, and proclaimed that the trials were
over. No one of his followers would <em>now</em> contend
with Asa Thor, he said, and night was approaching.
He then invited Thor and his companions to sit
down at the table, and spend the night with him
as his guests. Thor, though feeling somewhat
perplexed and mortified, accepted his invitation
courteously, and showed, by his agreeable behaviour
during the evening, that he knew how to bear
being conquered with a good grace.</p>

<p>In the morning, when Thor and his companions
were leaving the city, the King himself accompanied<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" id="Page_126" title="[Pg 126]"></a>
them without the gates; and Thor, looking steadily
at him when he turned to bid him farewell, perceived,
for the first time, that he was the very same
Giant Skrymir with whom he had met in the
forest.</p>

<p>"Come, now, Asa Thor," said the giant with
a strange sort of smile on his face, "tell me truly,
before you go, how you think your journey has
turned out, and whether or not I was right in
saying that you would meet with better men
than yourself in Jötunheim."</p>

<p>"I confess freely," answered Asa Thor, looking
up without any false shame on his face, "that I
have acquitted myself but humbly, and it grieves
me; for I know that in Jötunheim henceforward it
will be said that I am a man of little worth."</p>

<p>"By my troth! no," cried the giant, heartily.
"Never should you have come into my city if
I had known what a mighty man of valour you
really are; and now that you are safely out of
it, I will, for once, tell the truth to you, Thor.
All this time I have been deceiving you by my
enchantments. When you met me in the forest,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" id="Page_127" title="[Pg 127]"></a>
and hurled Miölnir at my head, I should have
been crushed by the weight of your blows
had I not skilfully placed a mountain between
myself and you, on which the strokes of your
hammer fell, and where you cleft three deep
ravines, which shall henceforth become verdant
valleys. In the same manner I deceived you
about the contests in which you engaged last night.
When Loki and Logi sat down before the trough,
Loki, indeed, eat like hunger itself; but Logi
is fire, who, with eager, consuming tongue, licked
up both bones and trough. Thialfi is the swiftest
of mortal runners; but the slender lad, Hugi,
was my thought; and what speed can ever equal
his? So it was in your own trials. When you
took such deep draughts from the horn, you little
knew what a wonderful feat you were performing.
The other end of that horn reached the ocean,
and when you come to the shore you will see
how far its waters have fallen away, and how
much the deep sea itself has been diminished by
your draught. Hereafter, men watching the going
out of the tide will call it the ebb, or draught<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" id="Page_128" title="[Pg 128]"></a>
of Thor. Scarcely less wonderful was the prowess
you displayed in the second trial. What appeared
to you to be a cat, was, in reality, the Midgard
serpent, which encircles the world. When we saw
you succeed in moving it we trembled lest the very
foundations of earth and sea should be shaken by
your strength. Nor need you be ashamed of having
been overthrown by the old woman Elli, for she
is old age; and there never has, and never will
be, one whom she has not the power to lay low.
We must now part, and you had better not come
here again, or attempt anything further against
my city; for I shall always defend it by fresh
enchantments, and you will never be able to do
anything against me."</p>

<p>At these words Thor raised Miölnir, and was
about to challenge the giant to a fresh trial of
strength; but, before he could speak, <a class="corr" name="corr_3" id="corr_3" title="was: Utgarda">Utgard</a>
vanished from his sight; and, turning round to
look for the city, he found that it, too, had disappeared,
and that he was standing alone on a
smooth, green, empty plain.</p>

<p>"What a fool I have been," said Asa Thor, aloud,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" id="Page_129" title="[Pg 129]"></a>
"to allow myself to be deceived by a mountain
giant!"</p>

<p>"Ah," answered a voice from above, "I told
you, you would learn to know yourself better by
your journey to Jötunheim. It is the great use
of travelling."</p>

<p>Thor turned quickly round again, thinking to
see Skrymir behind him; but, after looking on
every side, he could perceive nothing, but that
a high, cloud-capped mountain, which he had noticed
on the horizon, appeared to have advanced to the
edge of the plain.</p>

<h3><a name="II_II_THE_SERPENT" id="II_II_THE_SERPENT"></a>PART II. THE SERPENT AND THE KETTLE.</h3>

<p>Thor turned away from Giant-land, and on the
road homeward he passed through the Sea-King's
dominions. There he found that Ægir the Old
was giving a banquet to all the Æsir in his wide
coral-caves. At a little distance Thor stood still
to listen and to look. It was a fair sight: cave
within cave stretched out before him decked with
choicest shells, whilst far inward lay the banqueting-hall,
lighted with shining gold; white and red
coral-pillars stood at uneven distances; the bright-browed
Æsir reclined at the board on soft water
couches; Ægir's daughters&mdash;the fair-haired waves&mdash;murmured
sweet music as they waited on their<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" id="Page_131" title="[Pg 131]"></a>
guests; and little baby-ripples ran about laughing
in all the corners. Thor walked through the caves
and entered the hall. As he did so Odin looked
up from his place at Ægir's right hand, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good evening, son Thor; how has it fared
with you in Jötunheim?"</p>

<p>Thor's face grew a little cloudy at this question,
and he only answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not as it ought to have done, father." Then
he placed himself amongst Ægir's guests.</p>

<p>"In my dominions," said King Ægir, looking
all round, "an extraordinary thing has happened."</p>

<p>"And what may that be, brother?" asked Niörd.</p>

<p>"From the shores of Jötunheim," answered
Ægir, "the sea has run back a quarter of a mile,
drawing itself away as if a giant were drinking
it in."</p>

<p>"Is that all you have got to say, father?" said
a tall Wave, as she swept her hair over the Sea-King's
shoulder, and peeped up from behind him;
"is that all you know of the wonders which are
going on in your deep home? Listen."</p>

<p>Then Ægir bent forward on his seat; the Æsir<a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" id="Page_132" title="[Pg 132]"></a>
all ceased speaking, and drew in their breath; the
waves raised their arched necks, and were still,
listening. From a great way off came the sound
of a sullen swell.</p>

<p>"Who is that speaking?" asked Odin.</p>

<p>"That is Jörmungand speaking," said Thor.</p>

<p>"And what does he say, Thor?"</p>

<p>"He says that I could not conquer him."</p>

<p>"Pass round the foaming mead," cried Ægir,
who saw that it was time to turn the conversation.</p>

<p>But alas! Ægir's mead-kettle was so small, that
before it had gone half down the table it stood
empty before Tyr.</p>

<p>"There is a giant called Hymir," remarked
Tyr, "who lives far over the stormy waves to eastward
at the end of heaven."</p>

<p>The Æsir all looked up.</p>

<p>"He has a kettle," Tyr went on to say, "which
is a mile deep, and which would certainly hold
mead enough for all this company."</p>

<p>"If Hymir would lend it to us," said Ægir, "we
could finish our supper; but who would go to the
end of heaven to borrow a kettle?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" id="Page_133" title="[Pg 133]"></a></p>

<p>Then Thor rose from the table, and began to
tighten round him his belt of power; he put on his
iron gloves, and took Miölnir in his hand.</p>

<p>"What! off again to Giant-land, Ving-Thor?"
cried Ægir.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say you wanted Mile-deep?" said
Thor. "I am going to borrow it of Hymir for you.
Will you come with me, Tyr?"</p>

<p>Tyr sprang up joyfully, and the two brothers
started on their journey. When they arrived
at Hymir's dwelling, which was a roughly-hewn
cavern on the shore of a frozen sea, the first
person they met was a wonderful giantess with
nine hundred heads, in which glittered fiery eyes,
and which grew out from all parts of her body, so
that it was impossible to tell whether she was
walking upon her head or her heels. As Thor and
Tyr were looking at her trying to discover this,
a woman came out of the giant's home quite as
lovely as the giantess was hideous. She greeted
them on the threshold. Her golden hair fell thick
upon her shoulders; her mild eyes shone upon
them; and with words of welcome she held out<a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" id="Page_134" title="[Pg 134]"></a>
her hands and led them into the cavern. There
she offered them meat and drink, and bade them
rest until her husband, Hymir, should come home.
As the darkness came on, however, and the time of
his expected return drew near, she became silent and
anxious; and at last she said, "I am very much afraid
that my husband will be angry if he sees strangers
here when he comes in. Take my advice, now, Asa
Thor and Asa Tyr, and hide behind one of these pillars
in the rock. My lord, I assure you, is surly sometimes,
and not nearly so hospitable as I could wish."</p>

<p>"We are not accustomed to hide ourselves,"
remarked Thor.</p>

<p>"But you shall come forth when I call you,"
answered the woman.</p>

<p>So the Æsir did as she desired. By-and-bye
they heard heavy footsteps far off, over the frozen
sea, coming nearer and nearer every moment. The
distant icebergs resounded, and at last Hymir
burst open the door of his cavern, and stalked
angrily in. He had been unsuccessful that day
in the chase, his hands were frost-bitten, and a
"hard-frozen wood stood upon his cheek."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" id="Page_135" title="[Pg 135]"></a></p>

<p>As soon as the fair-browed woman saw what mood
he was in she went gently towards him, placed her
hand in his, and told him of the arrival of the
guests; then, with a sweet smile and voice, she
entreated him to receive the strangers kindly, and
entertain them hospitably.</p>

<p>Hymir made no answer; but, at one glance of
his eye towards the place where the Æsir were
hidden, the pillar burst asunder, and the cross-beam
which it supported fell with a crash to the
ground. Eight ponderous kettles had been hanging
on the beam, and all but one were shivered
to atoms.</p>

<p>Thor and Tyr then stepped forth into the middle
of the hall, and Hymir received them civilly, after
which he turned his attention to supper; and, having
cooked three whole oxen, he invited the Æsir to
eat with him. Thor fell to work with great relish,
and when he had eaten the whole of one ox, prepared
to cut a slice out of another.</p>

<p>"You eat a great deal," said Hymir, sulkily,
but Thor was still very hungry, and went on with
his supper until he had eaten two entire oxen.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" id="Page_136" title="[Pg 136]"></a>
Then said Hymir, "Another night, Ving-Thor,
you must provide your own supper; for I can't
undertake to keep so expensive a guest."</p>

<p>Accordingly, early the next morning, Hymir
prepared to go out fishing, and offered Thor a
place in his boat. On their way to the shore
they passed a herd of oxen feeding.</p>

<p>"Have you provided a bait for me?" said Thor
to the giant.</p>

<p>"You must get one for yourself," answered
Hymir, surlily.</p>

<p>So Thor was obliged to cut off the head of one
of the oxen for a bait.</p>

<p>"You'll never be able to carry <em>that</em> head," said
Hymir; for, in truth, the ox to which it had
belonged was an enormous animal, called "Heaven
Breaking."</p>

<p>But Thor made nothing of the head, slung it
over his shoulder, and carried it down to the boat.
As they got under <span class="sic" title="[sic]">weigh</span>, Thor and Hymir each
took an oar; but Thor pulled so fast, and with such
mighty strokes, that the giant was obliged to stop
for breath, and beg that they might go no further.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" id="Page_137" title="[Pg 137]"></a></p>

<p>"We have already reached the spot," he said,
"where I always catch the finest whales."</p>

<p>"But I want to go further out to sea," said
Thor.</p>

<p>"That will be dangerous, Ving-Thor," said
Hymir; "for if we row any further we shall come
to the waters under which Jörmungand lies."</p>

<p>Thor laughed, and rowed on. At last he stopped,
baited his hook with the ox's head, and cast the line
out into the sea, whilst Hymir leant over the other
side of the boat, and caught two whales.</p>

<p>Now, when the great Jörmungand smelt Thor's
bait he opened wide his monstrous jaws, and eagerly
sucked in both head, and hook, and line; but no
sooner did he feel the pain than he struggled so
fiercely, and plunged so wildly, that Thor's hands
were in an instant dashed against the sides of the
boat. Still Thor did not lose his hold, but went
on pulling with such wondrous force that his
feet burst through the boat, and rested on the
slippery rocks beneath. At last the venomous
monster's mountain-high head was hauled above
the waves, and then, indeed, it was a dreadful<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" id="Page_138" title="[Pg 138]"></a>
sight to see Thor, in all the power of his god-like
strength, casting his fiery looks on the serpent,
and the serpent glaring upon him, and spitting
forth poisoned venom. Even Hymir's sun-burnt
cheek changed colour as he beheld beneath his
feet the sinking boat, and at his side the deadliest
monster of the deep. At last, in the wildness of
his fear, he rushed before Thor, and cut his line
in sunder. Immediately the serpent's head began
to sink; but Thor hurled Miölnir with fearful force
after it into the waters.</p>

<p>Then did the rocks burst; it thundered through
the caverns; old mother earth all shrank; even the
fishes sought the bottom of the ocean; but the
serpent sank back, with a long, dull sound, beneath
the waves, a deep wound in his head, and smothered
vengeance in his heart.</p>

<p>Ill at ease and silent, Hymir then turned to go
home, and Thor followed him, carrying boat and
oars, and everything else, on his shoulders. Now,
every fresh sight of Thor increased the giant's
envy and rage; for he could not bear to think
that he had shown so little courage before his<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" id="Page_139" title="[Pg 139]"></a>
brave guest, and, besides, losing his boat and getting
so desperately wet in his feet by wading home
through the sea, did not by any means improve
his temper. When they got home, therefore,
and were supping together, he began jeering and
taunting Thor.</p>

<p>"No doubt, Asa Thor," he said, "you think
yourself a good rower and a fine fisher, though
you did not catch anything to-day; but can
you break that drinking-cup before you, do you
think?"</p>

<p>Thor seized the cup, and dashed it against an
upright stone. But, lo! the stone was <a class="corr" name="corr_4" id="corr_4" title="was: shatterd">shattered</a>
in pieces, and the cup unbroken. Again, with
greater strength, he hurled the cup against the
pillars in the rock: it was still without a crack.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the beautiful woman was
sitting spinning at her wheel just behind where
Thor was standing. From time to time she chanted
snatches of old runes and sagas in soft tones; and
now, when Thor stood astonished that the cup was
not broken, the woman's voice fell on his ear,
singing low the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" id="Page_140" title="[Pg 140]"></a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Hard the pillar, hard the stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harder yet the giant's bone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stones shall break and pillars fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hymir's forehead breaks them all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then Thor once more took the cup, and hurled
it against the giant's forehead. The cup was this
time shivered to pieces; but Hymir himself was
unhurt, and cried out, "Well done at last, Ving-Thor;
but can you carry that mile-deep kettle
out of my hall, think you?"</p>

<p>Tyr tried to lift it, and could not even raise the
handle.</p>

<p>Then Thor grasped it by the rim, and, as he did
so, his feet pressed through the floor. With a mighty
effort he lifted it; he placed it on his head, while
the rings rang at his feet; and so in triumph he
bore off the kettle, and set out again for Ægir's Hall.</p>

<p>After journeying a little way he chanced to look
round, and then he saw that a host of many-headed
giants, with Hymir for their leader, were thronging
after him. From every cavern, and iceberg, and
jagged peak some hideous monster grinned and
leered as a great wild beast waiting for his prey.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" id="Page_141" title="[Pg 141]"></a></p>

<p>"Treachery!" cried Thor, as he raised Miölnir
above his head, and hurled it three times among
the giants.</p>

<p>In an instant they stood stiff, and cold, and
dead, in rugged groups along the shore; one with
his arm raised; another with his head stretched
out; some upright, some crouching; each in the
position he had last assumed. And there still
they stand, petrified by ages into giant rocks; and,
still pointing their stony fingers at each other, they
tell the mighty tale of Thor's achievements, and
the wondrous story of their fate.</p>

<p>"Pass round the foaming mead," cried King
Ægir, as Thor placed "Mile-deep" on the table;
and this time it happened that there was enough
for every one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thor, as his name implies, was the thunder god;
his realm was called Thrudvang, which is said to
mean the "Region of Fortitude." Of his hall, Bilskirnir
(storm-serene), Odin says, "Five hundred floors, and
forty eke, has Bilskirnir with its windings. Of all the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" id="Page_142" title="[Pg 142]"></a>
roofed houses that I know is my son's the greatest."
His hammer, Miölnir, "To pound, or grind,"&mdash;Megingjardir,
his belt of prowess&mdash;his goats, whose
names signify "To crack, grind, gnash" and "race at
intervals"&mdash;his attendant Thialfi, the swift falling
thunder shower, all help to picture him in this
character; but he ought to be understood, also, in the
larger sense of a god of cultivation and the order
of nature, in opposition to the whole tribe of
the Hrimthursar, frost-giants, mountain-giants, fog-enchantments,
and the like sterile portions and
retarding forces of the physical world. The principle
of combat in the physical world, Thor appears
also as the chief hero-god and warrior; his victories
are moral as well as physical&mdash;his life was unceasing
warfare.</p>

<p>In the <i>Edda</i> account of Thor going to Utgard,
the giant-king whom he finds there is called
Utgard-<em>Loki</em>; and it is to be observed that
Loki, who, we saw, had his own root in fire, is in
Utgard opposed to Logi who is also fire, so that in
this myth Loki stands in opposition to two beings
nearly akin to himself. This may be explained as<a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" id="Page_143" title="[Pg 143]"></a>
follows. Utgard, outer-world, or under-world, means
outside of both the human and godly regions, and
reminds us of the chaotic, elementary powers.
Utgard-Loki, or out-worldly-Loki, represents outside
of human world in its evil aspect&mdash;the destructive
apart from the formative principle. Connected with
him appears elementary fire (Logi), and Loki is
opposed to the latter because at the time this myth
was conceived he had come to mean evil <em>in</em> the world
rather than that elementary double-natured fire out
of which the idea of his evil had originally crept.
This view of Utgard, viz., its connection with the
chaotic powers, explains the apparent defeats of Thor
during his visit there, for Thor is a deity of the
formed universe, he can subdue <em>that</em> to his will, not
the first double-natured elements out of which it was
built up.</p>

<p>How naturally would the dark frozen land and
misty mountain shapes of the north, suggest to the
ancient song singers these ideas concerning outworldly
and inworldly giants and wild unfathomable
powers and enchanted combatants.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Asa Thor does not<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" id="Page_144" title="[Pg 144]"></a>
always appear in the favourable light in which the
tales given here represent him. There are one or
two very uncomfortable stories about him, bringing
out those dark traits of craft and cruelty which,
as we saw before, so often stained the bright shields of
northern warriors. In particular, there is a story
of his losing his hammer and going to Jötunheim to
recover it, disguised as Freyja. When his craft
had succeeded, and he felt the hammer in his grasp
again, "Loud laughed," says the lay, "the fierce hearted
one's soul in his breast." After which he slew, first
the giant who had robbed him, then <em>all</em> the giant's
race. Perhaps, even so far as that we could have forgiven
him, but&mdash;the giant, it is said, had "a luckless
sister, an aged sister," and the hero-god must need
slay her too. "Blows she got, a hammer's stroke," and
"so," ends the lay, "did Odin's son get his hammer
back," apparently well satisfied with the whole performance.
But are the Warrior-god's descendants so
very different from himself&mdash;the giant's sister, the aged,
luckless sister, who does not seem as if she could
do anybody much harm, is she not apt even now to
fall beneath the vengeful hammers of our modern<a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" id="Page_145" title="[Pg 145]"></a>
Thors, remorselessly stricken down after the real
battle has been fought and won?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the fierce thunder deity we turn to Njord's
bright children, Frey and Freyja, "Beauteous and
mighty."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />
FREY.</h2>


<h3><a name="III_I_ON_TIPTOE" id="III_I_ON_TIPTOE"></a>PART I. ON TIPTOE IN AIR THRONE.</h3>

<p>I told you, some time ago, how Van Frey went
away into Alfheim with the light elves, of whom
Odin made him king and schoolmaster.</p>

<p>You have heard what Frey was like, and the
kind of lessons he promised to teach his pupils,
so you can imagine what pleasant times they had
of it in Alfheim.</p>

<p>Wherever Frey came there was summer and
sunshine. Flowers sprang up under his footsteps,
and bright-winged insects, like flying flowers,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" id="Page_148" title="[Pg 148]"></a>
hovered round his head. His warm breath ripened
the fruit on the trees, and gave a bright yellow
colour to the corn, and purple bloom to the
grapes, as he passed through fields and vineyards.</p>

<p>When he rode along in his car, drawn by the
stately boar, Golden Bristles, soft winds blew before
him, filling the air with fragrance, and spreading
abroad the news, "Van Frey is coming!" and every
half-closed flower burst into perfect beauty, and
forest, and field, and hill, flushed their richest
colours to greet his presence.</p>

<p>Under Frey's care and instruction the pretty
little light elves forgot their idle ways, and learned
all the pleasant tasks he had promised to teach
them. It was the prettiest possible sight to see
them in the evening filling their tiny buckets, and
running about among the woods and meadows to
hang the dew-drops deftly on the slender tips of
the grass-blades, or to drop them into the half-closed
cups of the sleepy flowers. When this last
of their day's tasks was over they used to cluster
round their summer-king, like bees about the
queen, while he told them stories about the wars<a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" id="Page_149" title="[Pg 149]"></a>
between the Æsir and the giants, or of the old
time when he lived alone with his father Niörd,
in Noatun, and listened to the waves singing songs
of far distant lands. So pleasantly did they spend
their time in Alfheim.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all this work and play
Frey had a wish in his mind, of which he could
not help often talking to his clear-minded messenger
and friend Skirnir. "I have seen many
things," he used to say, "and travelled through
many lands; but to see all the world at once, as
Asa Odin does from Air Throne, <em>that</em> must be a
splendid sight."</p>

<p>"Only Father Odin may sit on Air Throne,"
Skirnir would say; and it seemed to Frey that
this answer was not so much to the purpose as
his friend's sayings generally were.</p>

<p>At length, one very clear summer evening, when
Odin was feasting with the other Æsir in Valhalla,
Frey could restrain his curiosity no longer. He
left Alfheim, where all the little elves were fast
asleep, and, without asking any one's advice,
climbed into Air Throne, and stood on tiptoe in<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" id="Page_150" title="[Pg 150]"></a>
Odin's very seat. It was a clear evening, and I
had, perhaps, better not even try to tell you what
Frey saw.</p>

<p>He looked first all round him over Manheim,
where the rosy light of the set sun still lingered,
and where men, and birds, and flowers were gathering
themselves up for their night's repose; then he
glanced towards the heavenly hills where Bifröst
rested, and then towards the shadowy land which
deepened down into Niflheim. At length he turned
his eyes northward to the misty land of Jötunheim.
There the shades of evening had already fallen; but
from his high place Frey could still see distinct
shapes moving about through the gloom. Strange
and monstrous shapes they were, and Frey stood a
little higher, on tiptoe, that he might look further
after them. In this position he could just descry a
tall house standing on a hill in the very middle of
Jötunheim. While he looked at it a maiden came
and lifted up her arms to undo the latch of the
door. It was dusk in Jötunheim; but when
this maiden lifted up her white arms, such a
dazzling reflection came from them, that Jötunheim,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" id="Page_151" title="[Pg 151]"></a>
and the sky, and all the sea were flooded
with clear light. For a moment everything could
be distinctly seen; but Frey saw nothing but
the face of the maiden with the uplifted arms;
and when she had entered the house and shut
the door after her, and darkness fell again on
earth, and sky, and sea,&mdash;darkness fell, too, upon
Frey's heart.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" id="Page_152" title="[Pg 152]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="III_II_THE_GIFT" id="III_II_THE_GIFT"></a>PART II. THE GIFT.</h3>

<p>The next morning, when the little elves awoke
up with the dawn, and came thronging round
their king to receive his commands, they were
surprised to see that he had changed since they
last saw him.</p>

<p>"He has grown up in the night," they whispered
one to another sorrowfully.</p>

<p>And in truth he was no longer so fit a teacher
and playfellow for the merry little people as he had
been a few hours before.</p>

<p>It was to no purpose that the sweet winds blew,
and the flowers opened, when Frey came forth
from his chamber. A bright white light still<a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" id="Page_153" title="[Pg 153]"></a>
danced before him, and nothing now seemed to him
worth looking at. That evening when the sun had
set, and work was over, there were no stories for
the light elves.</p>

<p>"Be still," Frey said, when they pressed round,
"If you will be still and listen, there are stories
enough to be heard better than mine."</p>

<p>I do not know whether the elves heard anything;
but to Frey it seemed that flowers, and
birds, and winds, and the whispering rivers, united
that day in singing one song, which he never
wearied of hearing.</p>

<p>"We are fair," they said; "but there is nothing
in the whole world so fair as Gerda, the giant-maiden
whom you saw last night in Jötunheim."</p>

<p>"Frey has dew-drops in his eyes," the little
elves said to each other in whispers as they sat
round looking up at him, and they felt very much
surprised; for only to men and the Æsir is it
permitted to be sorrowful and weep.</p>

<p>Soon, however, wiser people noticed the change
that had come over the summer king, and his
good-natured father, Niörd, sent Skirnir one day<a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" id="Page_154" title="[Pg 154]"></a>
into Alfheim to inquire into the cause of Frey's
sorrow.</p>

<p>He found him walking alone in a shady place,
and Frey was glad enough to tell his trouble to
his wise friend.</p>

<p>When he had related the whole story, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now you will see that there is no use in
asking me to be merry as I used to be; for how
can I ever be happy in Alfheim, and enjoy the
summer and sunshine, while my dear Gerd, whom
I love, is living in a dark, cold land, among
cruel giants?"</p>

<p>"If she be really as beautiful and beloved as
you say," answered Skirnir, "she must be sadly out
of place in Jötunheim. Why do not you ask her
to be your wife, and live with you in Alfheim?"</p>

<p>"That would I only too gladly do," answered
Frey; "but if I were to leave Alfheim only for
a few hours, the cruel giant, Ryme,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> would rush
in to take my place; all the labours of the year
would be undone in a night, and the poor, toiling
men, who are watching for the harvest, would<a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" id="Page_155" title="[Pg 155]"></a>
wake some morning to find their corn-fields and
orchards buried in snow."</p>

<p>"Well," said Skirnir, thoughtfully, "I am neither
so strong nor so beautiful as you, Frey; but, if
you will give me the sword that hangs by your
side, I will undertake the journey to Jötunheim;
and I will speak in such a way of you, and of
Alfheim, to the lovely Gerd, that she will gladly
leave her land and the house of her giant-father
to come to you."</p>

<p>Now, Frey's sword was a gift, and he knew
well enough that he ought not to part with it,
or trust it in any hands but his own; and yet
how could he expect Skirnir to risk all the
dangers of Jötunheim for any less recompense
than an enchanted sword? and what other hope
had he of ever seeing his dear Gerda again?</p>

<p>He did not allow himself a moment to think of
the choice he was making. He unbuckled his sword
from his side and put it into Skirnir's hands;
and then he turned rather pettishly away, and threw
himself down on a mossy bank under a tree.</p>

<p>"You will be many days in travelling to Jötunheim,"<a class="pagenum" name="Page_156" id="Page_156" title="[Pg 156]"></a>
he said, "and all that time I shall be
miserable."</p>

<p>Skirnir was too sensible to think this speech
worth answering. He took a hasty farewell of
Frey, and prepared to set off on his journey;
but, before he left the hill, he chanced to see
the reflection of Frey's face in a little pool of
water that lay near. In spite of its sorrowful
expression, it was as beautiful as the woods
are in full summer, and a clever thought came
into Skirnir's mind. He stooped down, without
Frey's seeing him, and, with cunning touch, stole
the picture out of the water; then he fastened
it up carefully in his silver drinking-horn, and,
hiding it in his mantle, he mounted his horse
and rode towards Jötunheim, secure of succeeding
in his mission, since he carried a matchless sword
to conquer the giant, and a matchless picture to
win the maiden.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" id="Page_157" title="[Pg 157]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="III_III_FAIREST" id="III_III_FAIREST"></a>PART III. FAIREST GERD.</h3>

<p>I told you that the house of Gymir, Gerda's
father, stood in the middle of Jötunheim, so it will
not be difficult for you to imagine what a toilsome
and wondrous journey Skirnir had. He was a
brave hero, and he rode a brave horse; but,
when they came to the barrier of murky flame
that surrounds Jötunheim, a shudder came over
both.</p>

<p>"Dark it is without," said Skirnir to his horse,
"and you and I must leap through flame, and
go over hoar mountains among Giant Folk. The
giants will take us both, or we shall return
victorious together."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_158" id="Page_158" title="[Pg 158]"></a></p>

<p>Then he patted his horse's neck, and touched
him with his armed heel, and with one bound he
cleared the barrier, and his hoofs rang on the
frozen land.</p>

<p>Their first day's journey was through the land
of the Frost Giants, whose prickly touch kills, and
whose breath is sharper than swords. Then they
passed through the dwellings of the horse-headed
and vulture-headed giants,&mdash;<a class="corr" name="corr_5" id="corr_5" title="was: Monsters">monsters</a> terrible to
see. Skirnir hid his face, and the horse flew
along swifter than the wind.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day they reached
Gymir's house. Skirnir rode round it nine times;
but though there were twenty doors, he could find
no entrance; for fierce three-headed dogs guarded
every door-way.</p>

<p>At length he saw a herdsman pass near, and
he rode up and asked him how it was possible for a
stranger to enter Gymir's house, or get a sight of
his fair daughter Gerd.</p>

<p>"Are you doomed to death, or are you
already a dead man," answered the herdsman,
"that you talk of seeing Gymir's fair daughter,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" id="Page_159" title="[Pg 159]"></a>
or entering a house from which no one ever
returns?"</p>

<p>"My death is fixed for one day," said Skirnir,
in answer, and his voice, the voice of an Asa,
sounded loud and clear through the misty air
of Jötunheim. It reached the ears of the
fair Gerd as she sat in her chamber with her
maidens.</p>

<p>"What is that noise of noises," she said, "that I
hear? The earth shakes with it, and all Gymir's
halls tremble."</p>

<p>Then one of the maidens got up, and peeped
out of the window.</p>

<p>"I see a man," she said; "he has dismounted
from his horse, and he is fearlessly letting it graze
before the door."</p>

<p>"Go out and bring him in stealthily, then,"
said Gerda; "I must again hear him speak;
for his voice is sweeter than the ringing of bells."</p>

<p>So the maiden rose, and opened the house-door
softly, lest the grim giant, Gymir, who was drinking
mead in the banquet-hall with seven other
giants, should hear and come forth.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" id="Page_160" title="[Pg 160]"></a></p>

<p>Skirnir heard the door open, and understanding
the maiden's sign, he entered with stealthy steps,
and followed her to Gerda's chamber. As soon as
he entered the doorway the light from her face
shone upon him, and he no longer wondered that
Frey had given up his sword.</p>

<p>"Are you the son of an Asa, or an Alf, or
of a wise Van?" asked Gerda; "and why have
you come through flame and snow to visit our
halls?"</p>

<p>Then Skirnir came forward and knelt at Gerda's
feet, and gave his message, and spoke as he had
promised to speak of Van Frey and of Alfheim.</p>

<p>Gerda listened; and it was pleasant enough to
talk to her, looking into her bright face; but she
did not seem to understand much of what he said.</p>

<p>He promised to give her eleven golden apples
from Idūna's grove if she would go with him, and
that she should have the magic ring Draupnir from
which every day a still fairer jewel fell. But he
found there was no use in talking of beautiful
things to one who had never in all her life seen
anything beautiful.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" id="Page_161" title="[Pg 161]"></a></p>

<p>Gerda smiled at him as a child smiles at a fairy
tale.</p>

<p>At length he grew angry. "If you are so
childish, maiden," he said, "that you can believe
only what you have seen, and have no thought of
Æsirland or the Æsir, then sorrow and utter
darkness shall fall upon you; you shall live alone
on the Eagle Mount turned towards Hel. Terrors
shall beset you; weeping shall be your lot. Men
and Æsir will hate you, and you shall be doomed
to live for ever with the Frost Giant, Ryme, in
whose cold arms you will wither away like a thistle
on a house-top."</p>

<p>"Gently," said Gerd, turning away her bright
head, and sighing. "How am I to blame? you
make such a talk of your Æsir and your Æsir;
but how can I know about it, when all my life long
I have lived with giants?"</p>

<p>At these words, Skirnir rose as if he would
have departed, but Gerda called him back.</p>

<p>"You must drink a cup of mead," she said,
"in return for your sweet-sounding words."</p>

<p>Skirnir heard this gladly, for now he knew<a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" id="Page_162" title="[Pg 162]"></a>
what he would do. He took the cup from her
hand, drank off the mead, and, before he returned
it, he contrived cleverly to pour in the
water from his drinking-horn, on which Frey's
image was painted; then he put the cup into Gerda's
hand, and bade her look.</p>

<p>She smiled as she looked; and the longer she
looked, the sweeter grew her smile; for she looked
for the first time on a face that loved her,
and many things became clear to her that
she had never understood before. Skirnir's
words were no longer like fairy tales. She could
now believe in Æsirland, and in all beautiful
things.</p>

<p>"Go back to your master," she said, at last,
"and tell him that in nine days I will meet
him in the warm wood Barri."</p>

<p>After hearing these joyful words, Skirnir made
haste to take leave, for every moment that he
lingered in the giant's house he was in danger.
One of Gerda's maidens conducted him to the
door, and he mounted his horse again, and rode
from Jötunheim with a glad heart.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" id="Page_163" title="[Pg 163]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="III_IV_THE_WOOD" id="III_IV_THE_WOOD"></a>PART IV. THE WOOD BARRI.</h3>

<p>When Skirnir got back to Alfheim, and told
Gerd's answer to Frey, he was disappointed to
find that his master did not immediately look as
bright and happy as he expected.</p>

<p>"Nine days!" he said; "but how can I wait
nine days? One day is long, and three days
are very long, but 'nine days' might as well
be a whole year."</p>

<p>I have heard children say such things when one
tells them to wait for a new toy.</p>

<p>Skirnir and old Niörd only laughed at it; but
Freyja and all the ladies of Asgard made a
journey to Alfheim, when they heard the story,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" id="Page_164" title="[Pg 164]"></a>
to comfort Frey, and hear all the news about
the wedding.</p>

<p>"Dear Frey," they said, "it will never do to
lie still here, sighing under a tree. You are
quite mistaken about the time being long; it is
hardly long enough to prepare the marriage presents,
and talk over the wedding. You have no
idea how busy we are going to be; everything
in Alfheim will have to be altered a little."</p>

<p>At these words Frey really did lift up his
head, and wake up from his musings. He looked,
in truth, a little frightened at the thought; but,
when all the Asgard ladies were ready to work
for his wedding, how could he make any objection?
He was not allowed to have much share
in the business himself; but he had little time,
during the nine days, to indulge in private
thought, for never before was there such a commotion
in Alfheim. The ladies found so many
things that wanted overlooking, and the little
light elves were not of the slightest use to
any one. They forgot all their usual tasks, and
went running about through groves and fields,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" id="Page_165" title="[Pg 165]"></a>
and by the sedgy banks of rivers, peering into
earth-holes, and creeping down into flower-cups
and empty snail-shells, every one hoping to find
a gift for Gerda.</p>

<p>Some stole the light from glow-worms' tails,
and wove it into a necklace, and others pulled
the ruby spots from cowslip leaves, to set with
jewels the acorn cups that Gerda was to drink
from; while the swiftest runners chased the
butterflies, and pulled feathers from their wings
to make fans and bonnet-plumes.</p>

<p>All the work was scarcely finished when the
ninth day came, and Frey set out from Alfheim
with all his elves, to the warm wood Barri.</p>

<p>The Æsir joined him on the way, and they
made, together, something like a wedding procession.
First came Frey in his chariot, drawn
by Golden Bristles, and carrying in his hand
the wedding-ring, which was none other than
Draupnir, the magic ring of which so many
stories are told.</p>

<p>Odin and Frigga followed with their wedding
gift, the Ship Skidbladnir, in which all the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" id="Page_166" title="[Pg 166]"></a>
Æsir could sit and sail, though it could afterwards
be folded up so small, that you might
carry it in your hand.</p>

<p>Then came Idūna, with eleven golden apples
in a basket on her fair head, and then two and
two all the heroes and ladies with their gifts.</p>

<p>All round them flocked the elves, toiling under
the weight of their offerings. It took twenty
little people to carry one gift, and yet there was
not one so large as a baby's finger. Laughing,
and singing, and dancing, they entered the warm
wood, and every summer flower sent a sweet
breath after them. Everything on earth smiled
on the wedding-day of Frey and Gerda, only&mdash;when
it was all over, and every one had gone
home, and the moon shone cold into the wood&mdash;it
seemed as if the Vanir spoke to one
another.</p>

<p>"Odin," said one voice, "gave his eye for
wisdom, and we have seen that it was well done."</p>

<p>"Frey," answered the other, "has given his sword
for happiness. It may be well to be unarmed
while the sun shines and bright days last; but<a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" id="Page_167" title="[Pg 167]"></a>
when Ragnarök has come, and the sons of Muspell
ride down to the last fight, will not Frey regret
his sword?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Frey appears as the summer god, and the Boar
was sacred to him because, from its tearing up the
earth with its tusks, it typified agriculture and return
of the seed-sowing time. Gerda is supposed to
represent the frozen earth, which Summer seeing
from far off loves and woos to his embrace. The
lighting of the sky by the uplifted giant maiden's
arms is explained to mean the Northern Lights
glancing from one end of heaven to the other.
Frey parts with his sword in order to win Gerda&mdash;this
is alluded to in both <i>Eddas</i> as if it were wrong
or at any rate highly imprudent. "When the sons
of Muspell come at Ragnarök," it is said, and
Frey shall have to meet Surtur in battle, "then
will thou, unhappy, not have wherewith to fight."
The ship Skidbladnir was said to have been made
by four dwarfs in the beginning of time; it is alluded
to in a poem quoted before. Draupnir is not mentioned<a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" id="Page_168" title="[Pg 168]"></a>
in the <i>Edda</i> in connection with Frey and
Gerda.</p>

<p>The Northmen had three grand religious festivals
in their year: they all took place in the winter
half of the year, between the harvest and seed
time. One was celebrated in midwinter about
the turn of the day, and from so very nearly
coinciding with our Christmas, its name, "Yule,"
came to be applied to the Christian festival.
Yule is derived from a name of Odin, but it is
said by Laing that this winter feast was held in
honour of Thor. In Fouqué's writings a custom
is named which the Scandinavians had of making
vows to accomplish some great enterprise before
another new year, over a golden boar's head at
this winter feast; the mention of the golden boar
seems to connect the festival with the god Frey,
probably it was a general propitiation of the summer
deities for the coming year; the second festival was
in honour of the goddesses; the third, about spring,
in honour of Odin, because at this season warlike
expeditions began to be undertaken.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />
THE WANDERINGS OF FREYJA.</h2>


<h3><a name="IV_I_THE_NECKLACE" id="IV_I_THE_NECKLACE"></a>PART I. THE NECKLACE BRISINGAMEN.</h3>

<p>Now, though Frey was made king and schoolmaster
of the light elves, and spent the greater
part of his time with them in Alfheim, his
sister Freyja remained in the city of Asgard, and
had a palace built for her named Folkvang. In
this palace there was one very beautiful hall,
Sessrymnir&mdash;the "Roomy Seated"&mdash;where Freyja
entertained her guests, and she had always plenty
of them; for every one liked to look at her
beautiful face, and listen to her enchanting music<a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" id="Page_170" title="[Pg 170]"></a>
which was quite superior to anybody else's. She
had, moreover, a wonderful husband named Odur,
who was one of the sons of the immortals, and
had come from a long way off on purpose to
marry her. Freyja was a little proud of this,
and used often to speak of it to Frigga and
the other ladies of Asgard. Some of them said
she was a very fortunate person; but some were a
little jealous of her, whilst Frigga always gravely
warned her not to be vain on account of her
happiness, lest sorrow should overtake her unawares.</p>

<p>Everything went on quite smoothly, however,
for a long time, Freyja leading a very gay and
beautiful life in the sunshine of her happiness,
and herself a very radiant joy to every one around
her. But one day, one unlucky day, Freyja, this
fair and sunshiny young Vana, went out alone
from Asgard to take a walk in Alfheim. She
hoped to meet somewhere thereabouts her dear
brother Frey, whom she had not seen for a long
time, and of whom she wanted to ask a very
particular favour. The occasion for it was this;&mdash;Heimdall<a class="pagenum" name="Page_171" id="Page_171" title="[Pg 171]"></a>
and Ægir were expected to dine at
Valhalla the next day, and Freyja and her husband
were invited to meet them. All the lords and
ladies of Asgard were to be there. Niörd, too,
was coming, with his new wife, Skadi, the daughter
of a giant.</p>

<p>"Every one will be beautifully dressed," said
Freyja, "and <em>I</em> have not a single ornament to
wear."</p>

<p>"But you are more beautiful than any one,
Freyja," said her husband; "for you were born
in the spacious Wind-Home."</p>

<p>"All are not so high-minded as you, Odur,"
answered his wife; "and if I go to Valhalla without
an ornament of any kind I shall certainly
be looked down upon."</p>

<p>So saying, Freyja set off, as I told you, to
Alfheim, determined to ask of her good-natured
brother a garland of flowers at, least. But
somehow or other she could not find Frey anywhere.
She tried to keep in Alfheim&mdash;she
thought she was there; but all the time she was
thinking of her dress and her ornaments, planning<a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" id="Page_172" title="[Pg 172]"></a>
what she should wear, and her steps went downward,
downward, away from Alfheim to the cavern
of four dwarfs.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" said Freyja to herself, as she
at last lost the light of day, and went down, wandering
on deeper and deeper between the high
walls, and under the firm roof of rock. "Why,
surely this must be Svartheim; and yet it is not
unpleasant, nor quite dark here, though the sun
is not shining."</p>

<p>And in truth it was not dark; for, far on before
her, winding in and out through the cavern's innermost
recesses, were groups of little men, who had
each a lantern in his cap and a pickaxe in his
hand; and they were working hard, digging for
diamonds, which they piled up the walls, and hung
across the roof in white and rose-coloured coronets,
marvellously glittering.</p>

<p>Four clever little dwarf-chiefs were there directing
the labours of the rest; but, as soon as they caught
sight of Freyja, they sat down in the centre of
the cavern, and began to work diligently at something
which they held between them, bending over<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" id="Page_173" title="[Pg 173]"></a>
it with strange chattering and grimaces. Freyja
felt very curious to see what it was; but her eyes
were so dazzled with the blaze of diamonds and
lanterns, that she was obliged to go nearer in
order to distinguish it clearly. Accordingly, she
walked on to where the four dwarfs were sitting,
and peeped over their shoulders. Oh! brilliant!
exquisitely worked! bewildering!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:335px">
<a name="ILLU_FREYJA" id="ILLU_FREYJA"></a>
<img src="images/i172.jpg" width="335" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Freyja in the Dwarfs' Cave.</div>
</div>

<p>Freyja drew back again with almost blinded
eyes; for she had looked upon the necklace Brisingamen,
and at the same moment a passionate
wish burst forth in her heart to have it for her
own, to wear it in Valhalla, to wear it always
round her own fair neck. "Life to me," said
Freyja, "is no longer worth having without Brisingamen."
Then the dwarfs held it out to her,
but also looked cunningly at one another as they
did so, and burst into a laugh so loud that it
rang through the vaulted caverns, echoed and
echoed back again from side to side, from dwarf
to dwarf, from depth to depth.</p>

<p>Freyja, however, only turned her head a little
on one side, stretched out her hand, grasped the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" id="Page_174" title="[Pg 174]"></a>
necklace with her small fingers, and then ran out
of the cavern as quickly as ever she could, up
again to the green hill-side. There she sat down and
fitted the brilliant ornament about her neck, after
which she looked a little shyly at the reflection
of herself in a still pool that was near, and turned
homewards with an exulting heart. She felt certain
that all was well with her; nevertheless, all
was not well, but very miserable indeed. When
Freyja was come back to Asgard again, and to her
palace of Folkvang, she sought her own private
apartments, that she might see Odur alone, and
make him admire her necklace Brisingamen. But
Odur was not there. She searched in every
room, hither and thither; but alas! he was not
to be found in any room or any hall in all the
palace of Folkvang. Freyja searched for him in
every place; she walked restlessly about, in and
out, among the places of the "Roomy Seated."
She peered wistfully, with sad eyes, in the face
of every guest; but the only face she cared to see,
she never saw.</p>

<p>Odur was gone, gone back for ever to the home<a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" id="Page_175" title="[Pg 175]"></a>
of the Immortals. Brisingamen and Odur could
not live together in the palace of Folkvang. But
Freyja did not know this; she did not know why
Odur was gone, nor where he was gone; she only
saw he was not there, and she wrung her hands
sadly, and watered her jewels with salt, warm
tears.</p>

<p>As she sat thus and mourned in the entrance
of her palace, all the ladies of Asgard passed
by on their way to Valhalla, and looked at her.
Some said one thing, some another; but no one
said anything at all encouraging, or much to the
purpose. Frigga passed by last of all, and she
raised her head with a little severe shake, saying
something about beauty, and pride, and punishment,
which sank down so deeply into the heart of
the sorrow-stricken young Vana that she got up
with a desperate resolution, and, presenting herself
before the throne of Asa Odin, spoke to him thus:
"Father of Æsir, listen to my weeping, and do
not turn away from me with a cruel frown. I
have searched through my palace of Folkvang, and
all through the city of Asgard, but nowhere is Odur<a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" id="Page_176" title="[Pg 176]"></a>
the Immortal to be found. Let me go, Father Odin,
I beseech you, and seek him far and near, across
the earth, through the air, over the sea, even to the
borders of Jötunheim."</p>

<p>And Odin answered, "Go, Freyja, and good
fortune go with you."</p>

<p>Then Freyja sprang into her swift, softly-rolling
chariot, which was drawn by two cats, waved her
hand as she rose over the city, and was gone.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" id="Page_177" title="[Pg 177]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="IV_II_LOKI" id="IV_II_LOKI"></a>PART II. LOKI&mdash;THE IRON WOOD&mdash;A BOUNDLESS WASTE.</h3>

<p>The cats champed their bright bits, and skimmed
alike over earth and air with swift, clinging steps,
eager and noiseless. The chariot rolled on, and
Freyja was carried away up and down into every
part of the world, weeping golden tears wherever
she went; they fell down from her pale cheeks,
and rippled away behind her in little sunshiny
rivers, that carried beauty and weeping to every
land. She came to the greatest city in the
world, and drove down its wide streets.</p>

<p>"But none of the houses here are good enough
for Odur," said Freyja to herself; "I will not
ask for him at such doors as these."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" id="Page_178" title="[Pg 178]"></a></p>

<p>So she went straight on to the palace of the
king.</p>

<p>"Is Odur in this palace?" she asked of the gate-keeper.
"Is Odur, the Immortal, living with
the king?"</p>

<p>But the gate-keeper shook his head, and assured her
that his master had never even heard of such a person.</p>

<p><span class="corr" title='removed: "'></span>Then Freyja turned away, and knocked at
many other stately doors, asking for Odur; but
no one in all that great city so much as knew
her husband's name.</p>

<p>Then Freyja went into the long, narrow lanes
and shabby streets, where the poor people lived,
but there it was all the same; every one said
only, "No&mdash;not here," and stared at her.</p>

<p>In the night-time Freyja went quite away from
the city, and the lanes, and the cottages, far
off to the side of a lake, where she lay down
and looked over into the water.</p>

<p>By-and-bye the moon came and looked there
too, and the Queen of Night saw a calm face in
the water, serene and high; but the Queen of
Beauty saw a troubled face, frail and fair.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" id="Page_179" title="[Pg 179]"></a></p>

<p>Brisingamen was reflected in the water too,
and its rare colours flashed from the little waves.
Freyja was pleased at the sight of her favourite
ornament, and smiled even in the midst of her
tears; but as for the moon, instead of Brisingamen,
the deep sky and the stars were
around her.</p>

<p>At last Freyja slept by the side of the lake,
and then a dark shape crept up the bank on
which she was lying, sat down beside her, and
took her fair head between its hands. It was
Loki, and he began to whisper into Freyja's ear
as she slept.</p>

<p>"You were quite right, Freyja," he said, "to go
out and try to get something for yourself in
Svartheim, instead of staying at home with your
husband. It was very wise of you to care more
for your dress and your beauty than for Odur. You
went down into Svartheim, and found Brisingamen.
Then the Immortal went away; but is not Brisingamen
better then he? Why do you cry,
Freyja? Why do you start so?"</p>

<p>Freyja turned, moaning, and tried to lift her<a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" id="Page_180" title="[Pg 180]"></a>
head from between his hands; but she could not,
and it seemed in her dream as if a terrible nightmare
brooded over her.</p>

<p>"Brisingamen is dragging me down," she cried
in her sleep, and laid her little hand upon the
clasp without knowing what she was doing.</p>

<p>Then a great laugh burst forth in Svartheim,
and came shuddering up through the vaulted
caverns until it shook the ground upon which she
lay. Loki started up, and was gone before
Freyja had time to open her eyes.</p>

<p>It was morning, and the young Vana prepared
to set out on her journey.</p>

<p>"Brisingamen is fair," she said, as she bade
farewell to her image in the lake. "Brisingamen
is fair; but I find it heavy sometimes."</p>

<p>After this, Freyja went to many cities, and
towns, and villages, asking everywhere for Odur;
but there was not one in all the world who
could tell her where he was gone, and at last
her chariot rolled eastward and northward to the
very borders of Jötunheim. There Freyja stopped;
for before her lay Jarnvid, the Iron Wood, which<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" id="Page_181" title="[Pg 181]"></a>
was one road from earth to the abode of the giants,
and whose tall trees, black and hard, were trying
to pull down the sky with their iron claws. In
the entrance sat an Iron Witch, with her back
to the forest and her face towards the Vana.
Jarnvid was full of the sons and daughters of this
Iron Witch; they were wolves, and bears, and
foxes, and many-headed ravenous birds.</p>

<p>"Eastward," croaked a raven as Freyja drew
near&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Eastward in the Iron Wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old one sitteth;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">and there she did sit, talking in quarrelsome tones
to her wolf-sons and vulture-daughters, who answered
from the wood behind her, howling, screeching,
and screaming all at the same time. There
was a horrible din, and Freyja began to fear that
her low voice would never be heard. She was
obliged to get out of her chariot, and walk close
up to the old witch, so that she might whisper
in her ear.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, old mother," she said, "where
Odur is? Have you seen him pass this way?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" id="Page_182" title="[Pg 182]"></a></p>

<p>"I don't understand one word of what you are
saying," answered the iron woman; "and if I did,
I have no time to waste in answering foolish
questions."</p>

<p>Now, the witch's words struck like daggers into
Freyja's heart, and she was not strong enough to
pull them out again; so she stood there a long
time, not knowing what she should do.</p>

<p>"You had better go," said the crone to her at
last; "there's no use in standing there crying."
For this was the grandmother of strong-minded
women, and she hated tears.</p>

<p>Then Freyja got into her chariot again, and
went westward a long way to the wide, boundless
land where impenetrable forests were growing, and
undying nature reigned in silence. She knew that
the silent Vidar was living there; for, not finding
any pleasure in the gay society of Asgard, he had
obtained permission from Father Odin to retire
to this place. "He is one of the Æsir, and perhaps
<em>he</em> will be able to help me," said the sad-hearted
young Vana, as her chariot rolled on through
empty moor-lands and forests, always in twilight<a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" id="Page_183" title="[Pg 183]"></a>
Her ear heard no sound, her eye saw no living
shape; but still she went on with a trembling
hope till she came to the spot</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Begrown with branches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was Vidar's dwelling."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Vidar was sitting there firm as an oak, and as
silent as night. Long grass grew up through
his long hair, and the branches of trees crossed
each other over his eyes; his ears were covered
with moss, and dewdrops glistened upon his
beard.</p>

<p>"It is almost impossible to get to him," sighed
Freyja, "through all these wet leaves, and I am
afraid his moss-covered ears are very deaf." But
she threw herself down on the ground before him,
and said, "Tell me, Vidar, does Odur hide among
thick trees? or is he wandering over the broad
west lands?"</p>

<p>Vidar did not answer her&mdash;only a pale gleam shot
over his face, as if reflected from that of Freyja,
like sunshine breaking through a wood.</p>

<p>"He does not hear me," said Freyja to herself,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" id="Page_184" title="[Pg 184]"></a>
and she crushed nearer to him through the
branches. "Only tell me, Vidar," she said, "is
Odur here?" But Vidar said nothing, for he had
no voice.</p>

<p>Then Freyja hid her face in her lap, and wept
bitterly for a long time. "An Asa," she said, at
last, looking up, "is no better to one than an
Iron Witch when one is really in trouble;" and
then she gathered her disordered dress about her,
threw back her long bright hair, and, springing
into her chariot, once again went wearily on her
way.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<h3><a name="IV_III_THE_KING" id="IV_III_THE_KING"></a>PART III. THE KING OF THE SEA AND HIS DAUGHTERS.</h3>

<p>At last she came to the wide sea-coast, and
there everything was gloriously beautiful. It was
evening, and the western sky looked like a broad
crimson flower. No wind stirred the ocean, but
the small waves rippled in rose-coloured froth on
the shore, like the smiles of a giant at play.</p>

<p>Ægir, the old sea-king, supported himself on
the sand, whilst the cool waters were laving his
breast, and his ears drank their sweet murmur; for
nine waves were his beautiful daughters, and they
and their father were talking together. Now,
though Ægir looked so stormy and old, he was
really as gentle as a child, and no mischief would<a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" id="Page_186" title="[Pg 186]"></a>
ever have happened in his kingdom if he had
been left to himself. But he had a cruel wife,
called Ran, who was the daughter of a giant,
and so eagerly fond of fishing that, whenever
any of the rough winds came to call upon her
husband, she used to steal out of the deep sea-caves
where she lived, and follow ships for miles
under the water, dragging her net after her, so
that she might catch any one who fell overboard.</p>

<p>Freyja wandered along the shore towards the
place where the Sea King was lying, and as she
went she heard him speaking to his daughters.</p>

<p>"What is the history of Freyja?" he asked.</p>

<p>And the first wave answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Freyja is a fair young Vana, who once was
happy in Asgard."</p>

<p>Then the second wave said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But she left her fair palace there, and Odur,
her Immortal Love."</p>

<p>Third wave,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She went down to the cavern of dwarfs."</p>

<p>Fourth wave,&mdash;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" id="Page_187" title="[Pg 187]"></a></p>

<p>"She found Brisingamen there, and carried it
away with her."</p>

<p>Fifth wave,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But when she got back to Folkvang she found
that Odur was gone."</p>

<p>Sixth wave,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because the Vana had loved herself more
than Immortal Love."</p>

<p>Seventh wave,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Freyja will never be happy again, for Odur
will never come back."</p>

<p>Eighth wave,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Odur will never come back as long as the
world shall last."</p>

<p>Ninth wave,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Odur will never return, nor Freyja forget
to weep."</p>

<p>Freyja stood still, spell-bound, listening, and
when she heard the last words, that Odur would
never come back, she wrung her hands, and
cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, Father Ægir! trouble comes, comes surging
up from a wide sea, wave over wave, into my soul."<a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" id="Page_188" title="[Pg 188]"></a>
And in truth it seemed as if her words had power
to change the whole surface of the ocean&mdash;wave
over wave rose higher and spoke louder&mdash;Ran
was seen dragging her net in the distance&mdash;old
Ægir shouted, and dashed into the deep&mdash;sea
and sky mixed in confusion, and night fell upon
the storm. Then Freyja sank down exhausted
on the sand, where she lay until her kind daughter,
the sleepy little Siofna, came and carried her home
again in her arms. After this the beautiful Vana
lived in her palace of Folkvang, with friends and
sisters, Æsir and Asyniur, but Odur did not return,
nor Freyja forget to weep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Freyja, as she appears in the Edda, was the
goddess of the beautiful year and of all sorts of
love. The story of her marriage with Odur is
extremely obscure; it is even thought that Odur
is only a form of Odin, and, in like manner, that
Freyja and Frigga are very intimately connected.</p>

<p>Frigga was the patroness of married love, of the
happiness and duties of the home (originally, she<a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" id="Page_189" title="[Pg 189]"></a>
and Freyja and all the great goddesses were probably
personifications of the earth); but Freyja, as goddess
of love, is less developed in idea than Frigga, she
has more of the nature goddess, less of the woman
in her. She was said to divide the spoil with Odin
in battle, taking half the slain for herself and leaving
him the other half, which points to her having
been at one time his wife and sharing all with him.
Supposing her to have been the beautiful year, or
rather the earth during the beautiful part of the
year, Odur leaving her would imply the beginning
of the shortening of the days at midsummer. The
source of summer flies, Summer seeks him weeping
golden tears. Do these mean Autumn's golden
leaves and falling fruits? or that the Sun's beautiful
gifts must ever follow him.</p>

<p>This myth of Summer's source, the Sun, declining
from the year has, it is supposed, been given to
Odur because it was not important enough to belong
to the greatest of the gods, although it was really
wrapped up in his nature, and the names Odur and
Odin are identical in German. Simrock says,
"Every mythology tells us of the death of the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" id="Page_190" title="[Pg 190]"></a>
beautiful part of the year like the flight of a god,
who is mourned by his wife or his beloved."
Looked at from this point of view, we see the
summerly earth vaunting and decking herself with
her richest jewels in the deepest pride of her delight
at the very moment when the spirit of her existence
is stealing away from her. The summer-decked
earth, without the sun of her life, is soulless, has
become mortal. But it must be confessed that the
<i>Edda</i> is very obscure about Brisingamen, and does
not mention the necklace in connection with Odur's
departure. The Iron Witch was the mother of two
wolves who devoured the sun and the moon at
Ragnarök, she is not mentioned in the myth of
Freyja, but in another lay. It has been suggested
that Freyja's tears may be dew, and she in the
character of Aurora when she sheds them, weeping
for some star god of the night.</p>

<p>We shall now hear the story of Idūna&mdash;a dwarf's
daughter, the wife of Bragi and goddess of Spring,
the renewing of life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />
IDŪNA'S APPLES.</h2>


<h3><a name="V_I_REFLECTIONS" id="V_I_REFLECTIONS"></a>PART I. REFLECTIONS IN THE WATER</h3>

<p>Of all the groves and gardens round the city of
Asgard&mdash;and they were many and beautiful&mdash;there
was none so beautiful as the one where Idūna,
the wife of Bragi, lived. It stood on the south
side of the hill, not far from Gladsheim, and it was
called "Always Young," because nothing that grew
there could ever decay, or become the least bit
older than it was on the day when Idūna entered
it. The trees wore always a tender, light green
colour, as the hedges do in spring. The flowers<a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" id="Page_192" title="[Pg 192]"></a>
were mostly half-opened, and every blade of grass
bore always a trembling, glittering drop of early
dew. Brisk little winds wandered about the grove,
making the leaves dance from morning till night
and swaying backwards and forwards the heads of
the flowers.</p>

<p>"Blow away!" said the leaves to the wind, "for
we shall never be tired."</p>

<p>"And you will never be old," said the winds
in answer. And then the birds took up the chorus
and sang,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never tired and never old."</p>

<p>Idūna, the mistress of the grove, was fit to live
among young birds, and tender leaves, and spring
flowers. She was so fair that when she bent over
the river to entice her swans to come to her, even
the stupid fish stood still in the water, afraid to
destroy so beautiful an image by swimming over
it; and when she held out her hand with bread
for the swans to eat, you would not have known
it from a water-lily&mdash;it was so wonderfully white.</p>

<p>Idūna never left her grove even to pay a visit
to her nearest neighbour, and yet she did not<a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" id="Page_193" title="[Pg 193]"></a>
lead by any means a dull life; for, besides having
the company of her husband, Bragi, who must have
been an entertaining person to live with; for he
is said to have known a story which never came
to an end, and yet which never grew wearisome.
All the heroes of Asgard made a point of coming
to call upon her every day. It was natural enough
that they should like to visit so beautiful a grove
and so fair a lady; and yet, to confess the truth,
it was not quite to see either the grove or Idūna
that they came.</p>

<p>Idūna herself was well aware of this, and
when her visitors had chatted a short time with
her, she never failed to bring out from the
innermost recess of her bower a certain golden
casket, and to request, as a favour, that her
guests would not think of going away till they
had tasted her apples, which, she flattered herself,
had a better flavour than any other fruit in
the world.</p>

<p>It would have been quite unlike a hero of
Asgard to have refused such courtesy; and, besides,
Idūna was not as far wrong about her<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" id="Page_194" title="[Pg 194]"></a>
apples as hostesses generally are, when they
boast of the good things on their tables.</p>

<p>There is no doubt her apples <em>had</em> a peculiar
flavour; and if any one of the heroes happened
to be a little tired, or a little out of spirits,
or a little cross, when he came into the bower,
it always followed that, as soon as he had
eaten one apple, he found himself as fresh, and
vigorous, and happy as he had ever been in
his life.</p>

<p>So fond were the heroes of these apples, and
so necessary did they think them to their daily
comfort, that they never went on a journey without
requesting Idūna to give them one or two,
to fortify them against the fatigues of the way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:332px">
<a name="ILLU_IDUNA" id="ILLU_IDUNA"></a>
<img src="images/i195.jpg" width="332" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Iduna Giving the Magic Apples.</div>
</div>

<p>Idūna had no difficulty in complying with this
request; she had no fear of her store ever failing<span class="corr" title="was: .">,</span>
for as surely as she took an apple from her
casket another fell in; but where it came from
Idūna could never discover. She never saw it
till it was close to the bottom of the casket; but
she always heard the sweet tinkling sound it
made when it touched the golden rim. It was<a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" id="Page_195" title="[Pg 195]"></a>
as good as play to Idūna to stand by her casket,
taking the apples out, and watching the fresh
rosy ones come tumbling in, without knowing
who threw them.</p>

<p>One spring morning Idūna was very busy taking
apples out of her casket; for several of the heroes
were taking advantage of the fine weather to journey
out into the world. Bragi was going from home
for a time; perhaps he was tired of telling his
story only to Idūna, and perhaps she was beginning
to know it by heart; and Odin, Loki, and Hœnir
had agreed to take a little tour in the direction
of Jötunheim, just to see if any entertaining adventure
would befall them. When they had all
received their apples, and taken a tender farewell
of Idūna, the grove&mdash;green and fair as it was&mdash;looked,
perhaps, a little solitary.</p>

<p>Idūna stood by her fountain, watching the bright
water as it danced up into the air and quivered,
and turned, and fell back, making a hundred
little flashing circles in the river; and then she
grew tired, for once, of the light and the noise,
and wandered down to a still place, where the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" id="Page_196" title="[Pg 196]"></a>
river was shaded by low bushes on each side, and
reflected clearly the blue sky overhead.</p>

<p>Idūna sat down and looked into the deep water.
Besides her own fair face there were little, wandering,
white clouds to be seen reflected there. She
counted them as they sailed past. At length a
strange form was reflected up to her from the
water&mdash;large, dark, lowering wings, pointed claws,
a head with fierce eyes&mdash;looking at her.</p>

<p>Idūna started and raised her head. It was above
as well as below; the same wings&mdash;the same eyes&mdash;the
same head&mdash;looking down from the blue
sky, as well as up from the water. Such a sight
had never been seen near Asgard before; and,
while Idūna looked, the thing waved its wings,
and went up, up, up, till it lessened to a dark spot
in the clouds and on the river.</p>

<p>It was no longer terrible to look at; but, as it
shook its wings a number of little black feathers
fell from them, and flew down towards the grove.
As they neared the trees, they no longer looked
like feathers&mdash;each had two independent wings and
a head of its own; they were, in fact, a swarm of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" id="Page_197" title="[Pg 197]"></a>
Nervous Apprehensions; troublesome little insects
enough, and well-known elsewhere, but which now,
for the first time, found their way into the grove.</p>

<p>Idūna ran away from them; she shook them
off; she fought quite bravely against them; but
they are by no means easy to get rid of; and
when, at last, one crept within the folds of her
dress, and twisted itself down to her heart, a new,
strange feeling thrilled there&mdash;a feeling never yet
known to any dweller in Asgard. Idūna did not
know what to make of it.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<h3><a name="V_II_THE_WINGED-GIANT" id="V_II_THE_WINGED-GIANT"></a>PART II. THE WINGED-GIANT.</h3>

<p>In the meantime Odin, Loki, and Hœnir proceeded
on their journey. They were not bound
on any particular quest. They strayed hither and
thither that Odin might see that things were going
on well in the world, and his subjects comporting
themselves in a becoming manner. Every now
and then they halted while Odin inspected the
thatching of a barn, or stood at the smithy to see
how the smith wielded his hammer, or in a furrow
to observe if the ploughman guided his plough-share
evenly through the soil. "Well done," he
said if the workman was working with all his
might; and he turned away, leaving something<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" id="Page_199" title="[Pg 199]"></a>
behind him, a straw in the barn, a piece of old
iron at the forge-door, a grain in the furrow&mdash;nothing
to look at; but ever after the barn was always full,
the forge-fire never went out, the field yielded
bountifully.</p>

<p>Towards noon the Æsir reached a shady valley,
and, feeling tired and hungry, Odin proposed to
sit down under a tree, and while he rested and
studied a book of runes which he had with him,
he requested Loki and Hœnir to prepare some
dinner.</p>

<p>"I will undertake the meat and the fire," said
Hœnir; "you, Loki, will like nothing better than
foraging about for what good things you can pick up."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I mean to do," said
Loki. "There is a farm-house near here, from
which I can perceive a savoury smell. It will be
strange, with my cunning, if I do not contrive to
have the best of all the dishes under this tree
before your fire is burnt up."</p>

<p>As Loki spoke he turned a stone in his hand,
and immediately he assumed the shape of a large
black cat. In this form he stole in at the kitchen-window<a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" id="Page_200" title="[Pg 200]"></a>
of a farm-house, where a busy housewife
was intent on taking pies and cakes from a deep
oven, and ranging them on a dresser under the
window. Loki watched his opportunity, and whenever
the mistress's back was turned he whisked a
cake or a pie out of the window.</p>

<p>"One, two, three. Why, there are fewer every
time I bring a fresh one from the oven!" cried
the bewildered housewife. "It's that thieving
cat. I see the end of her tail on the window-sill."
Out of the window leant the housewife to throw
a stone at the cat, but she could see nothing but
a thin cow trespassing in her garden; and when
she ran out with a stick to drive away the cow,
it, too, had vanished, and an old raven, with six
young ones, was flying over the garden-hedge.</p>

<p>The raven was Loki, the little ones were the
pies; and when he reached the valley, and changed
himself and them into their proper shapes, he had
a hearty laugh at his own cleverness, and at the
old woman's dismay.</p>

<p>"Well done, Loki, king of thieves," said a chorus
of foxes, who peeped out of their holes to see the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" id="Page_201" title="[Pg 201]"></a>
only one of the Æsir whose conduct they could
appreciate; but Odin, when he heard of it, was
very far from thinking it well done. He was
extremely displeased with Loki for having disgraced
himself by such mean tricks.</p>

<p>"It is true," he said, "that my subjects may
well be glad to furnish me with all I require, but
it should be done knowingly. Return to the farmhouse,
and place these three black stones on the
table from whence you stole the provisions."</p>

<p>Loki&mdash;unwilling as he was to do anything he
believed likely to bring good to others&mdash;was obliged
to obey. He made himself into the shape of a
white owl, flew once more through the window,
and dropped the stones out of his beak; they
sank deep into the table, and looked like three
black stains on the white deal-board.</p>

<p>From that time the housewife led an easy life;
there was no need for her to grind corn, or
mix dough, or prepare meat. Let her enter her
kitchen at what time of day she would, stores
of provisions stood smoking hot on the table. She
kept her own counsel about it, and enjoyed the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" id="Page_202" title="[Pg 202]"></a>
reputation of being the most economical house-keeper
in the whole country-side; but one thing
disturbed her mind, and prevented her thoroughly
enjoying the envy and wonder of the neighbouring
wives. All the rubbing, and brushing, and cleaning
in the world would not remove the three
black stains from her kitchen table, and as she
had no cooking to do, she spent the greater part
of her time in looking at them.</p>

<p>"If they were but gone," she said, a hundred
times every day, "I should be content; but how
is one to enjoy one's life when one cannot rub
the stains off one's own table?"</p>

<p>Perhaps Loki foresaw how the good wife would
use her gift; for he came back from the farm-house
in the best spirits. "We will now, with
Father Odin's permission, sit down to dinner,"
he said; "for surely, brother Hœnir, while I have
been making so many journeys to and fro, you
have been doing something with that fire which
I see blazing so fiercely, and with that old iron
pot smoking over it."</p>

<p>"The meat will be by this time ready, no<a class="pagenum" name="Page_203" id="Page_203" title="[Pg 203]"></a>
doubt," said Hœnir. "I killed a wild ox while
you were away, and part of it has been now for
some time stewing in the pot."</p>

<p>The Æsir now seated themselves near the fire,
and Hœnir lifted up the lid of the pot. A thick
steam rose up from it; but when he took out
the meat it was as red and uncooked as when
he first put it into the pot.</p>

<p>"Patience," said Hœnir; and Odin again took
out his book of Runes. Another hour passed, and
Hœnir again took off the lid, and looked at the meat;
but it was in precisely the same state as before.
This happened several times, and even the cunning
Loki was puzzled; when, suddenly, a strange
noise was heard coming from a tree near, and, looking
up, they saw an enormous human-headed eagle
seated on one of the branches, and looking at them
with two fierce eyes. While they looked it spoke.</p>

<p>"Give me my share of the feast," it said, "and
the meat shall presently be done."</p>

<p>"Come down and take it&mdash;it lies before you,"
said Loki, while Odin looked on with thoughtful
eyes; for he saw plainly that it was no mortal<a class="pagenum" name="Page_204" id="Page_204" title="[Pg 204]"></a>
bird who had the boldness to claim a share in
the Æsir's food.</p>

<p>Undaunted by Odin's majestic looks, the eagle
flew down, and, seizing a large piece of meat, was
going to fly away with it, when Loki, thinking
he had now got the bird in his power, took up a
stick that lay near, and struck a hard blow on the
eagle's back. The stick made a ringing sound as
it fell; but, when Loki tried to draw it back, he
found that it stuck with extraordinary force to the
eagle's back; neither could he withdraw his own
hands from the other end.</p>

<p>Something like a laugh came from the creature's
half-human, half-bird-like mouth; and then it
spread its dark wings and rose up into the air,
dragging Loki after.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," said Odin, as he saw the
eagle's enormous bulk brought out against the
sky; "it is Thiassi, the strongest giant in <a class="corr" name="corr_6" id="corr_6" title="was: Jotunheim">Jötunheim</a>,
who has presumed to show himself in our
presence. Loki has only received the reward of
his treachery, and it would ill-become us to interfere
in his behalf; but, as the monster is near,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" id="Page_205" title="[Pg 205]"></a>
it will be well for us to return to Asgard, lest any
misfortune should befall the city in our absence."</p>

<p>While Odin spoke, the winged creature had
risen up so high as to be invisible even to the
eyes of the Æsir; and, during their return to
Asgard, he did not again appear before them; but,
as they approached the gates of the city, they were
surprised to see Loki coming to meet them. He
had a crest-fallen and bewildered look; and when
they questioned him as to what had happened to
him since they parted in such a strange way, he
declared himself to be quite unable to give any
further account of his adventures than that he
had been carried rapidly through the air by the
giant, and, at last, thrown down from a great
height near the place where the Æsir met him.</p>

<p>Odin looked steadfastly at him as he spoke,
but he forbore to question him further: for he
knew well that there was no hope of hearing the
truth from Loki, and he kept within his own
mind the conviction he felt that some disastrous
result must follow a meeting between two such
evil-doers as Loki and the giant Thiassi.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" id="Page_206" title="[Pg 206]"></a></p>

<p>That evening, when the Æsir were all feasting
and telling stories to each other in the great hall
of Valhalla, Loki stole out from Gladsheim, and
went alone to visit Idūna in her grove. It was
a still, bright evening. The leaves of the trees
moved softly up and down, whispering sweet words
to each other; the flowers, with half-shut eyes,
nodded sleepily to their own reflections in the
water, and Idūna sat by the fountain, with her
head resting in one hand, thinking of pleasant
things.</p>

<p>"It is all very well," thought Loki; "but I
am not the happier because people can here live
such pleasant lives. It does not do me any good,
or cure the pain I have had so long in my heart."</p>

<p>Loki's long shadow&mdash;for the sun was setting&mdash;fell
on the water as he approached, and made
Idūna start. She remembered the sight that had
disturbed her so much in the morning; but when
she saw only Loki, she looked up and smiled
kindly; for he had often accompanied the other
Æsir in their visits to her grove.</p>

<p>"I am wearied with a long journey," said Loki<a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" id="Page_207" title="[Pg 207]"></a>
abruptly, "and I would eat one of your apples
to refresh me after my fatigue." The casket stood
by Idūna's side, and she immediately put in her
hand and gave Loki an apple. To her surprise,
instead of thanking her warmly, or beginning to
eat it, he turned it round and round in his hand
with a contemptuous air.</p>

<p>"It is true then," he said, after looking intently
at the apple for some time, "your apples
are but small and withered in comparison. I was
unwilling to believe it at first, but now I can
doubt no longer."</p>

<p>"Small and withered!" said Idūna, rising
hastily. <span class="corr" title='added: "'>"</span>Nay, Asa Odin himself, who has traversed
the whole world, assures me that he has
never seen any to be compared to them."</p>

<p>"That will never be said again," returned
Loki; "for this very afternoon I have discovered
a tree, in a grove not far from Asgard, on which
grow apples so beautiful that no one who has
seen them will ever care again for yours."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to see or hear of them," said
Idūna, trying to turn away with an indifferent<a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" id="Page_208" title="[Pg 208]"></a>
air; but Loki followed her, and continued to
speak more and more strongly of the beauty of
this new fruit, hinting that Idūna would be sorry
that she had refused to listen when she found
all her guests deserting her for the new grove,
and when even Bragi began to think lightly of
her and of her gifts. At this Idūna sighed, and
Loki came up close to her, and whispered in her
ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is but a short way from Asgard, and the
sun has not yet set. Come out with me, and, before
any one else has seen the apples, you shall
gather them, and put them in your casket, and
no woman shall ever have it in her power to
boast that she can feast the Æsir more sumptuously
than Idūna."</p>

<p>Now Idūna had often been cautioned by her
husband never to let anything tempt her to leave
the grove, and she had always been so happy
here, that she thought there was no use in
his telling her the same thing so often over; but
now her mind was so full of the wonderfully beautiful
fruit, and she felt such a burning wish to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" id="Page_209" title="[Pg 209]"></a>
get it for herself, that she quite forgot her husband's
commands.</p>

<p>"It is only a little way," she said to herself;
"there can be no harm in going out just this
once;" and, as Loki went on urging her, she
took up her casket from the ground hastily, and
begged him to show her the way to this other
grove. Loki walked very quickly, and Idūn had
not time to collect her thoughts before she found
herself at the entrance of Always Young. At the
gate she would gladly have stopped a minute to
take breath; but Loki took hold of her hand, and
forced her to pass through, though, at the very
moment of passing, she half drew back; for it seemed
to her as if all the trees in the grove suddenly
called out in alarm, "Come back, come back, Oh,
come back, Idūna!" She half drew back her hand,
but it was too late; the gate fell behind her, and
she and Loki stood together without the grove.</p>

<p>The trees rose up between them and the setting
sun, and cast a deep shadow on the place where
they stood; a cold, night air blew on Idūna's
cheek, and made her shiver.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_210" id="Page_210" title="[Pg 210]"></a></p>

<p>"Let us hasten on," she said to Loki; "let
us hasten on, and soon come back again."</p>

<p>But Loki was not looking on, he was looking
up. Idūna raised her eyes in the direction of his,
and her heart died within her; for there, high up
over her head, just as she had seen it in the
morning, hung the lowering, dark wings&mdash;the sharp
talons&mdash;the fierce head, looking at her. For one
moment it stood still above her head, and then
lower, lower, lower, the huge shadow fell; and,
before Idūn found breath to speak, the dark wings
were folded round her, and she was borne high
up in the air, northwards, towards the grey mist
that hangs over Jötunheim. Loki watched till she
was out of sight, and then returned to Asgard.
The presence of the giant was no wonder to
him; for he had, in truth, purchased his own
release by promising to deliver up Idūna and her
casket into his power; but, as he returned alone
through the grove, a foreboding fear pressed on his
mind.</p>

<p>"If it should be true," he thought, "that Idūna's
apples have the wonderful power Odin attributes<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" id="Page_211" title="[Pg 211]"></a>
to them! if I among the rest should suffer from
the loss!"</p>

<p>Occupied with these thoughts, he passed quickly
among the trees, keeping his eyes resolutely fixed
on the ground. He dare not trust himself to look
around; for once, when he had raised his head, he
fancied that, gliding through the brushwood, he
had seen the dark robes and pale face of his
daughter Hela.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<h3><a name="V_III_HELA" id="V_III_HELA"></a>PART III. HELA.</h3>

<p>When it was known that Idūna had disappeared
from her grove, there were many sorrowful faces
in Asgard, and anxious voices were heard inquiring
for her. Loki walked about with as grave a face,
and asked as many questions, as any one else;
but he had a secret fear that became stronger
every day, that now, at last, the consequence of
his evil ways would find him out.</p>

<p>Days passed on, and the looks of care, instead
of wearing away, deepened on the faces of the
Æsir. They met, and looked at each other, and
turned away sighing; each saw that some strange
change was creeping over all the others, and none<a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" id="Page_213" title="[Pg 213]"></a>
liked to be the first to speak of it. It came on
very gradually&mdash;a little change every day, and
no day ever passing without the change. The
leaves of the trees in Idūna's grove deepened in
colour. They first became a sombre green, then
a glowing red, and, at last, a pale brown; and
when the brisk winds came and blew them about,
they moved every day more languidly.</p>

<p>"Let us alone," they said at length. "We are
tired, tired, tired."</p>

<p>The winds, surprised, carried the new sound to
Gladsheim, and whispered it all round the banquet-hall
where the Æsir sat, and then they rushed
back again, and blew all through the grove.</p>

<p>"We are tired," said the leaves again; "we are
tired, we are old; we are going to die;" and at
the word they broke from the trees one by one,
and fluttered to the ground, glad to rest anywhere;
and the winds, having nothing else to do, went
back to Gladsheim with the last strange word they
had learned.</p>

<p>The Æsir were all assembled in Valhalla; but
there were no stories told, and no songs sung.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_214" id="Page_214" title="[Pg 214]"></a>
No one spoke much but Loki, and he was that
day in a talking humour. He moved from one
to another, whispering an unwelcome word in
every ear.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed your mother Frigga?" he
said to Baldur. "Do you see how white her hair
is growing, and what a number of deep lines are
printed on her face?"</p>

<p>Then he turned to Frey. "Look at your sister
Freyja and your friend Baldur," he said, "as they
sit opposite to us. What a change has come over
them lately! Who would think that that pale man
and that faded woman were Baldur the beautiful
and Freyja the fair?<span class="corr" title='added: "'>"</span></p>

<p>"You are tired&mdash;you are old&mdash;you are going
to die,"&mdash;moaned the winds, wandering all round
the great halls, and coming in and out of the
hundred doorways, and all the Æsir looked up
at the sad sound. Then they saw, for the first
time, that a new guest had seated herself that
day at the table of the Æsir. There could be no
question of her fitness on the score of royalty,
for a crown rested on her brow, and in her hand<a class="pagenum" name="Page_215" id="Page_215" title="[Pg 215]"></a>
she held a sceptre; but the fingers that grasped
the sceptre were white and fleshless, and under
the crown looked the threatening face of Hela,
half corpse, half queen.</p>

<p>A great fear fell on all the Æsir as they looked,
and only Odin found voice to speak to her.
"Dreadful daughter of Loki!" he said, "by
what warrant do you dare to leave the kingdom
where I permit you to reign, and come to take
your place among the Æsir, who are no mates
for such as you?"</p>

<p>Then Hela raised her bony finger, and pointed,
one by one, to the guests that sat round.
"White hair," she said, "wrinkled faces, weary
limbs, dull eyes&mdash;these are the warrants which
have summoned me from the land of shadows
to sit among the Æsir. I have come to claim
you, by these signs, as my future guests, and to
tell you that I am preparing a place for you in
my kingdom."</p>

<p>At every word she spoke a gust of icy wind
came from her mouth and froze the blood in the
listeners' veins. If she had stayed a moment<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" id="Page_216" title="[Pg 216]"></a>
longer they would have stiffened into stone; but
when she had spoken thus, she rose and left the
hall, and the sighing winds went out with her.</p>

<p>Then, after a long silence, Bragi stood up and
spoke. "Æsir," he said, "We are to blame. It
is now many months since Idūn was carried away
from us; we have mourned for her, but we have
not yet avenged her loss. Since she left us a
strange weariness and despair have come over us,
and we sit looking on each other as if we had
ceased to be warriors and Æsir. It is plain that,
unless Idūn returns, we are lost. Let two of us
journey to the Urda fount, which we have so long
neglected to visit, and enquire of her from the
Norns&mdash;for they know all things&mdash;and then, when
we have learnt where she is, we will fight for her
liberty, if need be, till we die; for that will be
an end more fitting for us than to sit here and
wither away under the breath of Hela."</p>

<p>At these words of Bragi the Æsir felt a revival
of their old strength and courage. Odin approved
of Bragi's proposal, and decreed that he and
Baldur should undertake the journey to the dwelling-place<a class="pagenum" name="Page_217" id="Page_217" title="[Pg 217]"></a>
of the Norns. That very evening they
set forth; for Hela's visit showed them that they
had no time to lose.</p>

<p>It was a weary time to the dwellers in Asgard
while they were absent. Two new citizens had
taken up their abode in the city, Age and Pain.
They walked the streets hand-in-hand, and there
was no use in shutting the doors against them; for
however closely the entrance was barred, the dwellers
in the houses felt them as they passed.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" id="Page_218" title="[Pg 218]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="V_IV_THROUGH_FLOOD" id="V_IV_THROUGH_FLOOD"></a>PART IV. THROUGH FLOOD AND FIRE.</h3>

<p>At length, Baldur and Bragi returned with the
answer of the Norns, couched in mystic words,
which Odin alone could understand. It revealed
Loki's treacherous conduct to the Æsir, and declared
that Idūn could only be brought back by Loki,
who must go in search of her, clothed in Freyja's
garments of falcon feathers.</p>

<p>Loki was very unwilling to venture on such a
search; but Thor threatened him with instant death
if he refused to obey Odin's commands, or failed
to bring back Idūna; and, for his own safety he
was obliged to allow Freyja to fasten the falcon
wings to his shoulders, and to set off towards<a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" id="Page_219" title="[Pg 219]"></a>
Thiassi's castle in Jötunheim, where he well knew
that Idūna was imprisoned.</p>

<p>It was called a castle; but it was, in reality, a
hollow in a dark rock; the sea broke against two
sides of it; and, above, the sea-birds clamoured
day and night.</p>

<p>There the giant had taken Idūna on the night
on which she had left her grove; and, fearing lest
Odin should spy her from Air Throne, he had shut
her up in a gloomy chamber, and strictly forbidden
her ever to come out. It was hard to be shut
up from the fresh air and sunshine; and yet,
perhaps, it was safer for Idūn than if she had
been allowed to wander about Jötunheim, and see
the monstrous sights that would have met her
there.</p>

<p>She saw nothing but Thiassi himself and his
servants, whom he had commanded to attend upon
her; and they, being curious to see a stranger
from a distant land, came in and out many times
every day.</p>

<p>They were fair, Idūna saw&mdash;fair and smiling;
and, at first, it relieved her to see such pleasant<a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" id="Page_220" title="[Pg 220]"></a>
faces round her, when she had expected something
horrible.</p>

<p>"Pity me!" she used to say to them; "pity
me! I have been torn away from my home and
my husband, and I see no hope of ever getting
back." And she looked earnestly at them; but their
pleasant faces never changed, and there was always&mdash;however
bitterly Idūn might be weeping&mdash;the
same smile on their lips.</p>

<p>At length Idūna, looking more narrowly at
them, saw, when they turned their backs to her,
that they were hollow behind; they were, in truth,
Ellewomen, who have no hearts, and can never
pity any one.</p>

<p>After Idūna saw this she looked no more at
their smiling faces, but turned away her head and
wept silently. It is very sad to live among
Ellewomen when one is in trouble.</p>

<p>Every day the giant came and thundered at
Idūna's door. "Have you made up your mind
yet," he used to say, "to give me the apples?
Something dreadful will happen to you if you
take much longer to think of it." Idūna trembled<a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" id="Page_221" title="[Pg 221]"></a>
very much every day, but still she had strength
to say, "No;" for she knew that the <em>most</em> dreadful
thing would be for her to give to a wicked giant
the gifts that had been entrusted to her for the
use of the Æsir. The giant would have taken
the apples by force if he could; but, whenever
he put his hand into the casket, the fruit slipped
from beneath his fingers, shrivelled into the size
of a pea, and hid itself in crevices of the casket
where his great fingers could not come&mdash;only when
Idūna's little white hand touched it, it swelled
again to its own size, and this she would never
do while the giant was with her. So the days
passed on, and Idūna would have died of grief
among the smiling Ellewomen if it had not been
for the moaning sound of the sea and the wild
cry of the birds; "for, however others may smile,
these pity me," she used to say, and it was like
music to her.</p>

<p>One morning when she knew that the giant
had gone out, and when the Ellewomen had left
her alone, she stood for a long time at her window
by the sea, watching the mermaids floating up<a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" id="Page_222" title="[Pg 222]"></a>
and down on the waves, and looking at heaven
with their sad blue eyes. She knew that they
were mourning because they had no souls, and
she thought within herself that even in prison it
was better to belong to the Æsir than to be a
mermaid or an Ellewoman, were they ever so free
or happy.</p>

<p>While she was still occupied with these thoughts
she heard her name spoken, and a bird with large
wings flew in at the window, and, smoothing its
feathers, stood upright before her. It was Loki
in Freyja's garment of feathers, and he made her
understand in a moment that he had come to set
her free, and that there was no time to lose. He
told her to conceal her casket carefully in her
bosom, and then he said a few words over her,
and she found herself changed into a sparrow, with
the casket fastened among the feathers of her
breast.</p>

<p>Then Loki spread his wings once more, and
flew out of the window, and Idūna followed him.
The sea-wind blew cold and rough, and her little
wings fluttered with fear; but she struck them<a class="pagenum" name="Page_223" id="Page_223" title="[Pg 223]"></a>
bravely out into the air and flew like an arrow
over the water.</p>

<p>"This way lies Asgard," cried Loki, and
the word gave her strength. But they had not
gone far when a sound was heard above the sea,
and the wind, and the call of the sea-birds. Thiassi
had put on his eagle plumage, and was flying
after them. For five days and five nights the
three flew over the water that divides Jötunheim
from Asgard, and, at the end of every day, they
were closer together, for the giant was gaining
on the other two.</p>

<p>All the five days the dwellers in Asgard stood
on the walls of the city watching. On the sixth
evening they saw a falcon and a sparrow, closely
pursued by an eagle, flying towards Asgard.</p>

<p>"There will not be time," said Bragi, who had
been calculating the speed at which they flew.
"The eagle will reach them before they can get
into the city."</p>

<p>But Odin desired a fire to be lighted upon the
walls; and Thor and Tyr, with what strength
remained to them, tore up the trees from the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_224" id="Page_224" title="[Pg 224]"></a>
groves and gardens, and made a rampart of fire
all round the city. The light of the fire showed
Idūna her husband and her friends waiting for
her. She made one last effort, and, rising high
up in the air above the flames and smoke, she
passed the walls, and dropped down safely at the
foot of Odin's throne. The giant tried to follow;
but, wearied with his long flight, he was unable
to raise his enormous bulk sufficiently high in
the air. The flames scorched his wings as he
flew through them, and he fell among the flaming
piles of wood, and was burnt to death.</p>

<p>How Idūn feasted the Æsir on her apples, how
they grew young and beautiful again, and how
spring, and green leaves, and music came back to
the grove, I must leave you to imagine, for I have
made my story long enough already; and if I say
any more you will fancy that it is Bragi who has
come among you, and that he has entered on his
endless story.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Idūna has a connection with the underworld,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_225" id="Page_225" title="[Pg 225]"></a>
carried away by a giant and kept captive in his
frozen regions, the earth meanwhile becoming
winterly, old; death threatening all things. Her
story is curiously hinted at in the <i>Elder Edda</i>, where
Idūna is represented as falling down from Yggdrasil's
Ash into the nether world. Odin sends Heimdall
and Bragi to bring her up again, and to ascertain
from her if she has been able to discover anything
about the destruction and duration of the world
and heaven. Instead of answering she bursts into
tears&mdash;the bright, tearful return of Spring&mdash;or may
this mean the impossibility of wringing from Nature
answers to the questions and longings that fill the
heart, even the tender year with its messages of
hope and hints of immortality is unable to give the
full assurance for which we yearn.</p>

<p>Idūna is supposed to typify the Spring, and her
falling into captivity for a time to the giant Thiassi
corresponds to the falling of the leaf in Autumn.
The union of Poetry with Spring seems very
appropriate, and we must not forget to mention
that Bragi's name calls to mind the old story of
the Bragarfull. At feasts, in old times, it was the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_226" id="Page_226" title="[Pg 226]"></a>
custom to drink from cups of mead. One to Odin
for victory, one to Frey and one to Niörd for a
good year and peace, and the fourth to Bragi.
It was called the "Cup of Vows," and the drinker
vowed over it to perform some great deed worthy
of the song of a skald.</p>

<p>In connection with the story of Idūna&mdash;being,
indeed, almost a sequel to it&mdash;we find the myth of
Skadi, which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The giant Thiassi had a very tall daughter, called
Skadi. When she found that her father never
returned from his pursuit of Idūn, she put on her
armour and set off to Asgard to revenge his death.
The heroes, however, were not inclined to allow
her the honour of a combat. They suggested to
her that, perhaps, it would answer her purpose as
well, if, instead of fighting them, she were to
content herself with marrying one of their number,
and it appeared to Skadi that this might possibly
be revenge enough. The Æsir, however, could
not make up their minds who should be the
victim. It was agreed, at last, that they should
all stand in some place of concealment where<a class="pagenum" name="Page_227" id="Page_227" title="[Pg 227]"></a>
only their feet could be seen, and that Skadi
should walk before them, and, by looking at the
feet, choose her husband. Now, Skadi had privately
made up her mind to marry Baldur; so, after
looking carefully at all the feet, she stopped before
a pair, which, from their beautiful shape, she
thought could only belong to the handsome Sun-god.
When, however, the figure belonging to the
feet emerged from the hiding-place, it was discovered
that she had chosen the bluff, gusty old
Niörd instead of the beautiful young Baldur; and
she was not particularly well pleased with her
choice, though she was obliged to abide by it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:329px">

<img src="images/i227.jpg" width="329" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Skadi Choosing Her Husband.</div>
</div>

<p>When Skadi and Niörd were married they found,
as persons do find who marry each other for the
shape of their feet, and other such wise reasons,
that it was not at all an easy thing to live happily
together. They could not even agree about the
place where they should live. Skadi was never
happy out of Thrymheim&mdash;the home of noise in
misty Jötunheim, and Niörd could not forget pleasant
Nöatun, and the clear, sunny seas where he had
dwelt in his youth. At last they agreed that they<a class="pagenum" name="Page_228" id="Page_228" title="[Pg 228]"></a>
would spend three days in Nöatun, and nine days in
Thrymheim; but one day, when Niörd was returning
to Nöatun, he could not help breaking out into the
following song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Of mountains I am weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine nights long and dreary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All up the misty hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wolf's long howl I heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought it sounded strangely&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methought it sounded ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the song of the swan bird."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And Skadi immediately answered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Never can I sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my couch by the strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the wild, restless waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolling over the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the scream of the seagulls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the mew as he cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These sounds chase for ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet sleep from mine eyes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Then, putting on a pair of snow-skates, she set
off more swiftly than the wind, and Niörd never
saw more of her. Ever afterwards, with her bow
in her hand, she spent her time in chasing wild
animals over the snow, and she is the queen and
patroness of all skaters.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_229" id="Page_229" title="[Pg 229]"></a></p>

<p>The next story is about Baldur, of whom Har
says "that he is the best of the sons of Odin. So
fair and dazzling that rays of light seem to issue
from him, and thou mayest form some idea of the
beauty of his hair when I tell thee that the whitest
of all plants is called 'Baldur's brow'" (a plant in
Sweden still called Baldur's eyebrow). Baldur is
the mildest, the wisest, and the most eloquent of
all the Æsir.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Broad glance 'tis called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Baldur the Fair<br /></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />
BALDUR.</h2>


<h3><a name="VI_I_THE_DREAM" id="VI_I_THE_DREAM"></a>PART I. THE DREAM.</h3>

<p>Upon a summer's afternoon it happened that
Baldur the Bright and Bold, beloved of men and
Æsir, found himself alone in his palace of Broadblink.
Thor was walking low down among the
valleys, his brow heavy with summer heat; Frey
and Gerda sported on still waters in their cloud-leaf
ship; Odin, for once, slept on the top of Air
Throne; a noon-day stillness pervaded the whole
earth; and Baldur in Broadblink, the wide-glancing
most sunlit of palaces, dreamed a dream.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_232" id="Page_232" title="[Pg 232]"></a></p>

<p>Now the dream of Baldur was troubled. He
knew not whence nor why; but when he awoke
he found that a most new and weighty care was
within him. It was so heavy that Baldur could
scarcely carry it, and yet he pressed it closely
to his heart, and said, "Lie there, and do not
fall on any one but me." Then he rose up,
and walked out from the expanded splendour of
his hall, that he might seek his own mother,
Frigga, and tell her what had happened to him.
He found her in her crystal saloon, calm and
kind, waiting to listen, and ready to sympathise;
so he walked up to her, his hands pressed closely
on his heart, and lay down at her feet sighing.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, dear Baldur?" asked
Frigga, gently.</p>

<p>"I do not know, mother," answered he. "I
do not know what the matter is; but I have a
shadow in my heart."</p>

<p>"Take it out, then, my son, and let me look
at it," replied Frigg.</p>

<p>"But I fear, mother, that if I do it will cover
the whole earth."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_233" id="Page_233" title="[Pg 233]"></a></p>

<p>Then Frigga laid her hand upon the heart of
her son that she might feel the shadow's shape.
Her brow became clouded as she felt it; her parted
lips grew pale, and she cried out, "Oh! Baldur,
my beloved son! the shadow is the shadow of
death!"</p>

<p>Then said Baldur, "I will die bravely, my
mother."</p>

<p>But Frigga answered, "You shall not die at
all; for I will not sleep to-night until everything
on earth has sworn to me that it will neither
kill nor harm you."</p>

<p>So Frigga stood up, and called to her everything
on earth that had power to hurt or slay. First
she called all metals to her; and heavy iron-ore
came lumbering up the hill into the crystal hall,
brass and gold, copper, silver, lead, and steel, and
stood before the Queen, who lifted her right-hand
high in the air, saying, "Swear to me that you
will not injure Baldur;" and they all swore, and
went. Then she called to her all stones; and
huge granite came with crumbling sand-stone, and
white lime, and the round, smooth stones of the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_234" id="Page_234" title="[Pg 234]"></a>
sea-shore, and Frigga raised her arm, saying,
"Swear that you will not injure Baldur;" and
they swore, and went. Then Frigga called to
her the trees; and wide-spreading oak-trees, with
tall ash and sombre firs came rushing up the hill,
with long branches, from which green leaves like
flags were waving, and Frigga raised her hand,
and said, "Swear that you will not hurt Baldur;"
and they said, "We swear," and went. After this
Frigga called to her the diseases, who came blown
thitherward by poisonous winds on wings of pain,
and to the sound of moaning. Frigga said to them,
"Swear:" and they sighed, "We swear," then flew
away. Then Frigga called to her all beasts, birds,
and venomous snakes, who came to her and swore,
and disappeared. After this she stretched out her
hand to Baldur, whilst a smile spread over her
face, saying, "And now, my son, you cannot die."</p>

<p>But just then Odin came in, and when he had
heard from Frigga the whole story, he looked even
more mournful than she had done; neither did
the cloud pass from his face when he was told of
the oaths that had been taken.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_235" id="Page_235" title="[Pg 235]"></a></p>

<p>"Why do you still look so grave, my lord?" demanded
Frigg, at last. "Baldur cannot now die."</p>

<p>But Odin asked very gravely, "Is the shadow
gone out of our son's heart, or is it still there?"</p>

<p>"It cannot be there," said Frigg, turning away
her head resolutely, and folding her hands before
her.</p>

<p>But Odin looked at Baldur, and saw how it
was. The hands pressed to the heavy heart, the
beautiful brow grown dim. Then immediately he
arose, saddled Sleipnir, his eight-footed steed,
mounted him, and, turning to Frigga, said, "I
know of a dead Vala,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Frigg, who, when she was
alive, could tell what was going to happen; her
grave lies on the east side of Helheim, and I
am going there to awake her, and ask whether any
terrible grief is really coming upon us."</p>

<p>So saying Odin shook the bridle in his hand,
and the Eight-footed, with a bound, leapt forth,
rushed like a whirlwind down the mountain of
Asgard, and then dashed into a narrow defile
between rocks.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_236" id="Page_236" title="[Pg 236]"></a></p>

<p>Sleipnir went on through the defile a long
way, until he came to a place where the earth
opened her mouth. There Odin rode in and
down a broad, steep, slanting road which led him
to the cavern Gnipa, and the mouth of the cavern
Gnipa yawned upon Niflheim. Then thought Odin
to himself, "My journey is already done." But
just as Sleipnir was about to leap through the
jaws of the pit, Garm, the voracious dog who
was chained to the rock, sprang forward, and
tried to fasten himself upon Odin. Three times
Odin shook him off, and still Garm, as fierce as
ever, went on with the fight. At last Sleipnir
leapt, and Odin thrust just at the same moment;
then horse and rider cleared the entrance, and
turned eastward toward the dead Vala's grave,
dripping blood along the road as they went; while
the beaten Garm stood baying in the cavern's
mouth.</p>

<p>When Odin came to the grave he got off his
horse, and stood with his face northwards looking
through barred enclosures into the city of Helheim
itself. The servants of Hela were very busy there<a class="pagenum" name="Page_237" id="Page_237" title="[Pg 237]"></a>
making preparations for some new guest&mdash;hanging
gilded couches with curtains of anguish and splendid
misery upon the walls. Then Odin's heart died
within him and he began to repeat mournful runes
in a low tone to himself.</p>

<p>The dead Vala turned heavily in her grave at
the sound of his voice, and, as he went on, sat
bolt upright. "What man is this," she asked,
"who dares disturb my sleep?"</p>

<p>Then Odin, for the first time in his life, said
what was not true; the shadow of Baldur dead
fell upon his lips, and he made answer, "My name
is Vegtam, the son of Valtam."</p>

<p>"And what do you want from me?" asked the
Vala.</p>

<p>"I want to know," replied Odin, "for whom
Hela is making ready that gilded couch in
Helheim?"</p>

<p>"That is for Baldur the Beloved," answered
the dead Vala. "Now go away, and let me sleep
again, for my eyes are heavy."</p>

<p>But Odin said, "Only one word more. Is Baldur
going to Helheim?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_238" id="Page_238" title="[Pg 238]"></a></p>

<p>"Yes, I've told you that he is," answered the
Vala.</p>

<p>"Will he never come back to Asgard again?"</p>

<p>"If everything on earth should weep for him,"
answered she, "he will go back; if not, he will
remain in Helheim."</p>

<p>Then Odin covered his face with his hands, and
looked into darkness.</p>

<p>"Do go away," said the Vala, "I'm so sleepy;
I cannot keep my eyes open any longer."</p>

<p>But Odin raised his head, and said again, "Only
tell me this one thing. Just now, as I looked into
darkness, it seemed to me as if I saw one on earth
who would not weep for Baldur. Who was it?"</p>

<p>At this the Vala grew very angry and said,
"How couldst <em>thou</em> see in darkness? I know
of only one who, by giving away his eye, gained
light. No Vegtam art thou, but Odin, chief of
men."</p>

<p>At her angry words Odin became angry too,
and called out as loudly as ever he could, "No
Vala art thou, nor wise woman, but rather the
mother of three giants."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_239" id="Page_239" title="[Pg 239]"></a></p>

<p>"Go, go!" answered the Vala, falling back in
her grave; "no man shall waken me again until
Loki have burst his chains and Ragnarök be
come." After this Odin mounted the Eight-footed
once more, and rode thoughtfully towards home.</p>

<h3><a name="VI_II_THE_PEACESTEAD" id="VI_II_THE_PEACESTEAD"></a>PART II. THE PEACESTEAD.</h3>

<p>When Odin came back to Asgard, Hermod took
the bridle from his father's hand, and told him
that the rest of the Æsir were gone to the Peacestead&mdash;a
broad, green plain which lay just outside
the city. Now this was, in fact, the playground of
the Æsir, where they practised trials of skill one
with another, and held tournaments and sham fights.
These last were always conducted in the gentlest
and most honourable manner; for the strongest law
of the Peacestead was, that no angry blow should be
struck, or spiteful word spoken, upon the sacred field;
and for this reason some have thought it might be
well if children also had a Peacestead to play in.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_241" id="Page_241" title="[Pg 241]"></a></p>

<p>Odin was too much tired by his journey from
Helheim to go to the Peacestead that afternoon;
so he turned away, and shut himself up in his
palace of Gladsheim. But when he was gone,
Loki came into the city by another way, and hearing
from Hermod where the Æsir were, set off
to join them.</p>

<p>When he got to the Peacestead, Loki found
that the Æsir were standing round in a circle
shooting at something, and he peeped between
the shoulders of two of them to find out what
it was. To his surprise he saw Baldur standing
in the midst, erect and calm, whilst his friends
and brothers were aiming their weapons at him.
Some hewed at him with their sword&mdash;others
threw stones at him&mdash;some shot arrows pointed
with steel, and Thor continually swung Miölnir
at his head. "Well," said Loki to himself, "if
this is the sport of Asgard, what must that of
Jötunheim be? I wonder what Father Odin and
Mother Frigg would say if they were here?" But
as Loki still looked, he became even more surprised,
for the sport went on, and Baldur was<a class="pagenum" name="Page_242" id="Page_242" title="[Pg 242]"></a>
not hurt. Arrows aimed at his very heart glanced
back again untinged with blood. The stones fell
down from his broad bright brow, and left no
bruises there. Swords clave, but did not wound
him; Miölnir struck him, and he was not crushed.
At this Loki grew perfectly furious with envy
and hatred. "And why is Baldur to be so
honoured," said he, "that even steel and stone
shall not hurt him?" Then Loki changed himself
into a little, dark, bent, old woman, with a stick
in his hand, and hobbled away from the Peacestead
to Frigga's cool saloon. At the door he knocked
with his stick.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said the kind voice of Frigg, and
Loki lifted the latch.</p>

<p>Now when Frigga saw, from the other end of
the hall, a little, bent, crippled, old woman, come
hobbling up her crystal floor, she got up with
true queenliness, and met her half way, holding
out her hand, and saying in the kindest manner,
"Pray sit down, my poor old friend; for it seems
to me that you have come from a great way
off."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_243" id="Page_243" title="[Pg 243]"></a></p>

<p>"That I have, indeed," answered Loki in a
tremulous, squeaking voice.</p>

<p>"And did you happen to see anything of the
Æsir," asked Frigg, "as you came?"</p>

<p>"Just now I passed by the Peacestead, and
saw them at play."</p>

<p>"What were they doing?"</p>

<p>"Shooting at Baldur."</p>

<p>Then Frigg bent over her work with a pleased
smile on her face. "And nothing hurt him?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered Loki, looking keenly at
her.<span class="corr" title='removed: "'></span></p>

<p>"No, nothing," murmured Frigg, still looking
down and speaking half musingly to herself; "for
all things have sworn to me that they will not."</p>

<p>"Sworn!" exclaimed Loki, eagerly; "what is
that you say? Has everything sworn then?"</p>

<p>"Everything," answered she, "excepting, indeed,
the little shrub mistletoe, which grows, you know,
on the west side of Valhal, and to which I said
nothing, because I thought it was too young to
swear."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_244" id="Page_244" title="[Pg 244]"></a></p>

<p>"Excellent!" thought Loki; and then he got
up.</p>

<p>"You're not going yet, are you?" said Frigg,
stretching out her hand and looking up at last
into the eyes of the old woman.</p>

<p>"I'm quite rested now, thank you," answered
Loki in his squeaky voice, and then he hobbled out
at the door, which clapped after him, and sent a
cold gust into the room. Frigga shuddered, and
thought that a serpent was gliding down the back
of her neck.</p>

<p>When Loki had left the presence of Frigg, he
changed himself back to his proper shape, and
went straight to the west side of Valhal, where
the mistletoe grew. Then he opened his knife,
and cut off a large branch, saying these words,
"Too young for Frigga's oaths, but not too weak for
Loki's work." After which he set off for the Peacestead
once more, the mistletoe in his hand. When
he got there he found that the Æsir were still
at their sport, standing round, taking aim, and
talking eagerly, and Baldur did not seem tired.</p>

<p>But there was one who stood alone, leaning against<a class="pagenum" name="Page_245" id="Page_245" title="[Pg 245]"></a>
a tree, and who took no part in what was going on.
This was Hödur, Baldur's blind twin-brother; he
stood with his head bent downwards, silent, whilst
the others were speaking, doing nothing when they
were most eager; and Loki thought that there
was a discontented expression on his face, just as
if he were saying to himself, "Nobody takes any
notice of me." So Loki went up to him, and
put his hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"And why are you standing here all alone, my
brave friend?" said he. <span class="corr" title='added: "'>"</span>Why don't <em>you</em> throw
something at Baldur. Hew at him with a sword,
or show him some attention of that sort."</p>

<p>"I haven't got a sword," answered Hödur, with
an impatient gesture; "and you know as well as
I do, Loki, that Father Odin does not approve
of my wearing warlike weapons, or joining in sham
fights, because I am blind."</p>

<p>"Oh! is that it?" said Loki. "Well, I only
know <em>I</em> shouldn't like to be left out of everything.
However, I've got a twig of mistletoe here which
I'll lend you if you like; a harmless little twig
enough, but I shall be happy to guide your<a class="pagenum" name="Page_246" id="Page_246" title="[Pg 246]"></a>
arm if you would like to throw it, and Baldur
might take it as a compliment from his twin-brother."</p>

<p>"Let me feel it," said Hödur, stretching out
his uncertain hands.</p>

<p>"This way, this way, my dear friend," said Loki,
giving him the twig. <span class="corr" title='added: "'>"</span>Now, as hard as ever you
can, to do <em>him honour</em>; throw!"</p>

<p>Hödur threw&mdash;Baldur fell, and the shadow of
death covered the whole earth.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_247" id="Page_247" title="[Pg 247]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="VI_III_BALDUR" id="VI_III_BALDUR"></a>PART III. BALDUR DEAD.</h3>

<p>One after another they turned and left the Peacestead,
those friends and brothers of the slain. One
after another they turned and went towards the city;
crushed hearts, heavy footsteps, no word amongst
them, a shadow upon all. The shadow was in
Asgard too,&mdash;had walked through Frigga's hall, and
seated itself upon the threshold of Gladsheim.
Odin had just come out to look at it, and Frigg
stood by in mute despair as the Æsir came up.</p>

<p>"Loki did it! Loki did it!" they said at last
in confused, hoarse whispers, and they looked from
one to another, upon Odin, upon Frigg, upon the
shadow which they saw before them, and which<a class="pagenum" name="Page_248" id="Page_248" title="[Pg 248]"></a>
they felt within. "Loki did it! Loki, Loki!"
they went on saying; but it was no use repeating
the name of Loki over and over again when there
was another name they were too sad to utter which
yet filled all their hearts&mdash;Baldur. Frigga said
it first, and then they all went to look at him
lying down so peacefully on the grass&mdash;dead, dead.</p>

<p>"Carry him to the funeral pyre!" said Odin, at
length; and four of the Æsir stooped down, and
lifted their dead brother.</p>

<p>With scarcely any sound they carried the body
tenderly to the sea-shore, and laid it upon the
deck of that majestic ship called Ringhorn, which
had been <em>his</em>. Then they stood round waiting to
see who would come to the funeral. Odin came, and
on his shoulders sat his two ravens, whose croaking
drew clouds down over the Asa's face, for Thought
and Memory sang one sad song that day. Frigga
came,&mdash;Frey, Gerda, Freyja, Thor, Hœnir, Bragi, and
Idūn. Heimdall came sweeping over the tops of the
mountains on Golden Mane, his swift, bright steed.
Ægir the Old groaned from under the deep, and
sent his daughters up to mourn around the dead.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_249" id="Page_249" title="[Pg 249]"></a>
Frost-giants and mountain-giants came crowding
round the rimy shores of Jötunheim to look across
the sea upon the funeral of an Asa. Nanna came,
Baldur's fair young wife; but when she saw the
dead body of her husband her own heart broke
with grief, and the Æsir laid her beside him on
the stately ship. After this Odin stepped forward,
and placed a ring on the breast of his son, whispering
something at the same time in his ear; but
when he and the rest of the Æsir tried to push
Ringhorn into the sea before setting fire to it,
they found that their hearts were so heavy they
could lift nothing. So they beckoned to the
giantess Hyrrokin to come over from Jötunheim
and help them. She, with a single push, set the
ship floating, and then, whilst Thor stood up
holding Miölnir high in the air, Odin lighted
the funeral pile of Baldur and of Nanna.</p>

<p>So Ringhorn went out floating towards the deep,
and the funeral fire burnt on. Its broad red
flame burst forth towards heaven; but when the
smoke would have gone upward too, the winds
came sobbing and carried it away.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_250" id="Page_250" title="[Pg 250]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="VI_IV_HELHEIM" id="VI_IV_HELHEIM"></a>PART IV. HELHEIM.</h3>

<p>When at last the ship Ringhorn had floated out
so far to sea that it looked like a dull, red lamp
on the horizon, Frigga turned round and said,
"Does any one of you, my children, wish to perform
a noble action, and win my love for ever?"</p>

<p>"I do," cried Hermod, before any one else had
time to open his lips.</p>

<p>"Go, then, Hermod," answered Frigg, "saddle
Sleipnir with all speed, and ride down to Helheim;
there seek out Hela, the stern mistress of the
dead, and entreat her to send our beloved back
to us once more."</p>

<p>Hermod was gone in the twinkling of an eye,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_251" id="Page_251" title="[Pg 251]"></a>
not in at the mouth of the earth and through the
steep cavern down which Odin went to the dead
Vala's grave; he chose another way, though not
a better one; for, go to Helheim how you will,
the best is but a downward road, and so Hermod
found it&mdash;downward, slanting, slippery, dark and
very cold. At last he came to the Giallar Bru&mdash;that
sounding river which flows between the living
and the dead, and the bridge over which is paved
with stones of glittering gold. Hermod was surprised
to see gold in such a place; but as he
rode over the bridge, and looked down carefully
at the stones, he saw that they were only tears
which had been shed round the beds of the dying&mdash;only
tears, and yet they made the way seem
brighter. But when Hermod reached the other
end of the bridge, he found the courageous woman
who, for ages and ages, had been sitting there
to watch the dead go by, and she stopped him
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a noise you make. Who are you?
Yesterday five troops of dead men went over the
Giallar Bridge, and did not shake it so much as<a class="pagenum" name="Page_252" id="Page_252" title="[Pg 252]"></a>
you have done. Besides," she added, looking more
closely at Hermod, "you are not a dead man at
all. Your lips are neither cold nor blue. Why,
then, do you ride on the way to Helheim?"</p>

<p>"I seek Baldur," answered Hermod. "Tell me,
have you seen him pass?"</p>

<p>"Baldur," she said, "has ridden over the bridge;
but there below, towards the north, lies the way
to the Abodes of Death."</p>

<p>So Hermod went on the way until he came to
the barred gates of Helheim itself. There he
alighted, tightened his saddle-girths, remounted,
clapped both spurs to his horse, and cleared the
gate by one tremendous leap. Then Hermod
found himself in a place where no living man had
ever been before&mdash;the City of the Dead. Perhaps
you think there is a great silence there, but you
are mistaken. Hermod thought he had never in
his life heard so much noise; for the echoes of all
words were speaking together&mdash;words, some newly
uttered and some ages old; but the dead men did
not hear who flitted up and down the dark streets,
for their ears had been stunned and become cold<a class="pagenum" name="Page_253" id="Page_253" title="[Pg 253]"></a>
long since. Hermod rode on through the city until
he came to the palace of Hela, which stood in the
midst. Precipice was its threshold, the entrance-hall,
Wide Storm, and yet Hermod was not too
much afraid to seek the innermost rooms; so he
went on to the banqueting-hall, where Hela sat
at the head of her table, and served her newest
guests. Baldur, alas! sat at her right-hand, and
on her left his pale young wife. When Hela saw
Hermod coming up the hall she smiled grimly,
but beckoned to him at the same time to sit down,
and told him that he might sup that night with
her. It was a strange supper for a living man to
sit down to. Hunger was the table; Starvation,
Hela's knife; Delay her man; Slowness, her
maid; and Burning Thirst, her wine. After supper
Hela led the way to the sleeping apartments.
"You see," she said, turning to Hermod, "I am
very anxious about the comfort of my guests. Here
are beds of unrest provided for all, hung with
curtains of weariness, and look how all the walls
are furnished with despair."</p>

<p>So saying she strode away, leaving Hermod and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_254" id="Page_254" title="[Pg 254]"></a>
Baldur together. The whole night they sat on
those unquiet couches and talked. Hermod could
speak of nothing but the past, and as he looked
anxiously round the room his eyes became dim
with tears. But Baldur seemed to see a light
far off, and he spoke of what was to come.</p>

<p>The next morning Hermod went to Hela, and
entreated her to let Baldur return to Asgard. He
even offered to take his place in Helheim if she
pleased; but Hela only laughed at this, and said,
"You talk a great deal about Baldur, and boast
how much every one loves him; I will prove now
if what you have told me be true. Let everything
on earth, living or dead, weep for Baldur and he
shall go home again; but if <em>one</em> thing only refuse
to weep, then let Helheim hold its own; he shall
<em>not</em> go."</p>

<p>"Every one will weep willingly," said Hermod,
as he mounted Sleipnir, and rode towards the
entrance of the city. Baldur went with him as
far as the gate, and began to send messages to all
his friends in Asgard, but Hermod would not listen
to many of them.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_255" id="Page_255" title="[Pg 255]"></a></p>

<p>"You will so soon come back to us," he said,
"there is no use in sending messages."</p>

<p>So Hermod darted homewards, and Baldur
watched him through the bars of Helheim's gateway
as he flew along.</p>

<p>"Not soon, not soon," said the dead Asa; but
still he saw the light far off, and thought of what
was to come.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_256" id="Page_256" title="[Pg 256]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="VI_V_WEEPING" id="VI_V_WEEPING"></a>PART V. WEEPING.</h3>

<p>"Well, Hermod, what did she say?" asked the
Æsir from the top of the hill, as they saw him
coming; "make haste and tell us what she said."
And Hermod came up.</p>

<p>"Oh! is that all?" they cried, as soon as he
had delivered his message. "Nothing can be
more easy;" and then they all hurried off to
tell Frigga. She was weeping already, and in
five minutes there was not a tearless eye in
Asgard.</p>

<p>"But this is not enough," said Odin; "the
whole earth must know of our grief that it may
weep with us."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_257" id="Page_257" title="[Pg 257]"></a></p>

<p>Then the father of the Æsir called to him his
messenger maidens&mdash;the beautiful Valkyrior&mdash;and
sent them out into all worlds with these three
words on their lips, "Baldur is dead!" But the
words were so dreadful that at first the messenger
maidens could only whisper them in low tones
as they went along, "Baldur is dead!" The
dull, sad sounds flowed back on Asgard like a
new river of grief, and it seemed to the Æsir as if
they now wept for the first time&mdash;"Baldur is dead!"</p>

<p>"What is that the Valkyrior are saying?" asked
the men and women in all the country round,
and when they heard rightly, men left their labour
and lay down to weep&mdash;women dropped the buckets
they were carrying to the well, and, leaning their
faces over them, filled them with tears. The
children crowded upon the doorsteps, or sat down
at the corners of the streets, crying as if their
own mothers were dead.</p>

<p>The Valkyrior passed on. "Baldur is dead!"
they said to the empty fields; and straightway
the grass and the wild field-flowers shed tears.
"Baldur is dead!" said the messenger maidens<a class="pagenum" name="Page_258" id="Page_258" title="[Pg 258]"></a>
to the rocks and the stones; and the very stones
began to weep. "Baldur is dead!" the Valkyrior
cried; and even the old mammoth's bones, which
had lain for centuries under the hills, burst into
tears, so that small rivers gushed forth from every
mountain's side. "Baldur is dead!" said the messenger
maidens as they swept over silent sands;
and all the shells wept pearls. "Baldur is dead!"
they cried to the sea, and to Jötunheim across
the sea; and when the giants understood it, even
they wept, whilst the sea rained spray to heaven.
After this the Valkyrior stepped from one stone to
another until they reached a rock that stood alone
in the middle of the sea; then, all together, they
bent forward over the edge of it, stooped down
and peeped over, that they might tell the monsters
of the deep. "Baldur is dead!" they said; and,
the sea monsters and the fish wept. Then the
messenger maidens looked at one another, and
said, "Surely our work is done." So they twined
their arms round one another's waists, and set forth
on the downward road to Helheim, there to claim
Baldur from among the dead.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_259" id="Page_259" title="[Pg 259]"></a></p>

<p>Now after he had sent forth his messenger
maidens, Odin had seated himself on the top of
Air Throne that he might see how the earth received
his message. At first he watched the
Valkyrior as they stepped forth north and south,
and east and west; but soon the whole earth's
steaming tears rose up like a great cloud, and
hid everything from him. Then he looked down
through the cloud, and said, "Are you all weeping?"
The Valkyrior heard the sound of his voice
as they went all together down the slippery road,
and they turned round, stretching out their arms
towards Air Throne, their long hair falling back,
whilst, with choked voices and streaming eyes,
they answered, "The world weeps, Father Odin;
the world and we."</p>

<p>After this they went on their way until they
came to the end of the cave Gnipa, where Garm
was chained, and which yawned over Niflheim.
"The world weeps," they said one to another by
way of encouragement, for here the road was so
dreadful; but just as they were about to pass
through the mouth of Gnipa they came upon a<a class="pagenum" name="Page_260" id="Page_260" title="[Pg 260]"></a>
haggard witch named Thaukt, who sat in the
entrance with her back to them, and her face towards
the abyss. "Baldur is dead! Weep, weep!"
said the messenger maidens, as they tried to pass
her; but Thaukt made answer&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"What she doth hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let Hela keep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For naught care I,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though the world weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O'er Baldur's bale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live he or die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tearless eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old Thaukt shall wail."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">And with these words leaped into Niflheim with
a yell of triumph.</p>

<p>"Surely that cry was the cry of Loki," said
one of the maidens; but another pointed towards
the city of Helheim, and there they saw the stern
face of Hela looking over the wall.</p>

<p>"One has not wept," said the grim Queen,
"and Helheim holds its own." So saying she
motioned the maidens away with her long, cold
hand.</p>

<p>Then the Valkyrior turned and fled up the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_261" id="Page_261" title="[Pg 261]"></a>
steep way to the foot of Odin's throne, like a
pale snow-drift that flies before the storm.</p>

<p>After this a strong child, called Vali, was born
in the city of Asgard. He was the youngest of
Odin's sons&mdash;strong and cold as the icy January
blast; but full, also, as it is of the hope of the new
year. When only a day old he slew the blind
Hödur by a single blow, and then spent the rest
of his life in trying to lift the shadow of death
from the face of the weeping earth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The death of Baldur was probably in the first
place an expression of the decline of the Summer
sun. At midsummer Freyja's husband forsook her,
at midsummer also the bright god begins to turn
his face Helheim-wards. Midsummer day is observed
in the North of Europe under the name of Beltan,
and fires are lighted upon the hills, a custom which
evidently had its origin in a commemoration of
Baldur's death. Some think that Baldur and Hödur
typify the two halves of the year. At the turn of
the day in Summer Höd kills Baldur, at the turn of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_262" id="Page_262" title="[Pg 262]"></a>
the day in Winter Vali kills Hödur. Vali was the
son of Odin and Rind, a giantess, whose name
means the winterly earth, so that clearly Vali comes
at midwinter. Why the mistletoe should be used to
kill Baldur it is difficult to say. Might its being so
weak and small imply the very small beginning of
the day's decline.</p>

<p>But Baldur, from the description given of him
in the <i>Edda</i>, must surely be a personification of
goodness morally, as well as the sun of the outward
year, and his not returning from Helheim, being
retained there through the machinations of Loki,
seems to be a sort of connecting link between the
first sorrow of the gods, the beginning of evil and
their final defeat by the evil powers at Ragnarök&mdash;the
giants have already one foot upon the gods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The hero of the next story is Tyr, mentioned in
the first chapter as the only one of the Æsir who
could feed the monster Fenrir.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />
THE BINDING OF FENRIR.</h2>


<h3><a name="VII_I_THE_MIGHT" id="VII_I_THE_MIGHT"></a>PART I. THE MIGHT OF ASGARD.</h3>

<p>I hope you have not forgotten what I told you
of Fenrir, Loki's fierce wolf-son, whom Odin
brought home with him to Asgard, and of whose
reformation, uncouth and wolfish as he was, All-Father
entertained some hope, thinking that the
wholesome, bright air of Gladsheim, the sight of
the fair faces of the Asyniur and the hearing of the
brave words which day by day fell from the lips
of heroes, would, perhaps, have power to change
the cruel nature he had inherited from his father,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_264" id="Page_264" title="[Pg 264]"></a>
and make him worthy of his place as a dweller
in the City of Lords.</p>

<p>To Tyr, the brave and strong-handed, Odin
assigned the task of feeding Fenrir, and watching
him, lest, in his cruel strength, he should injure
any who were unable to defend themselves. And
truly it was a grand sight, and one that Asa Odin
loved, to see the two together, when, in the
evening after the feast was over in Valhalla,
Fenrir came prowling to Tyr's feet to receive his
food from the one hand strong enough to quell him.</p>

<p>Tyr stood up in his calm strength like a tall,
sheltering rock in which the timid sea-birds find
a home; and Fenrir roared and howled round him
like the bitter, destroying wave that slowly undermines
its base.</p>

<div class="caption">Tyr Feeding Fenrir.</div>
</div>

<p>Time passed on. Tyr had reached the prime of
his strength; but Fenrir went on growing, not
so rapidly as to awaken fear, as his brother Jörmungand
had done, but slowly, surely, continually&mdash;a
little stronger and a little fiercer every day.</p>

<p>The Æsir and the Asyniur had become accustomed
to his presence; the gentlest lady in Asgard no<a class="pagenum" name="Page_265" id="Page_265" title="[Pg 265]"></a>
longer turned away from the sight of his fierce
mouth and fiery eye; they talked to each other
about the smallest things, and every daily event
was commented on and wondered about; but no
one said anything of Fenrir, or noticed how gradually
he grew, or how the glad air and the strong
food, which gave valour and strength to an Asa,
could only develope with greater rapidity fierceness
and cruelty in a wolf. And they would have
gone on living securely together while the monster
grew and grew, if it had not been that Asa Odin's
one eye, enlightened as it was by the upspringing
well of wisdom within, saw more clearly than the
eyes of his brothers and children.</p>

<p>One evening, as he stood in the court of Valhalla
watching Tyr as he gave Fenrir his evening
meal, a sudden cloud of care fell on the placid
face of All-Father, and when the wolf, having
satisfied his hunger, crouched back to his lair, he
called together a council of the heads of the Æsir&mdash;Thor,
Tyr, Bragi, Hœnir, Frey, and Niörd; and,
after pointing out to them the evil which they had
allowed to grow up among them unnoticed, he<a class="pagenum" name="Page_266" id="Page_266" title="[Pg 266]"></a>
asked their counsel as to the best way of overcoming
it before it became too strong to withstand.</p>

<p>Thor, always ready, was the first to answer.
"One would think," he said, "to hear the grave
way in which you speak, Father Odin, that there
was no such thing as a smithy near Asgard, or
that I, Asa Thor, had no power to forge mighty
weapons, and had never made my name known
in Jötunheim as the conqueror and binder of
monsters. Set your mind at rest. Before to-morrow
evening at this time I will have forged
a chain with which you shall bind Fenrir; and,
once bound in a chain of my workmanship, there
will be nothing further to fear from him."</p>

<p>The assembled Æsir applauded Thor's speech;
but the cloud did not pass away from Odin's
brow.</p>

<p>"You have done many mighty deeds, Son Thor,"
he said; "but, if I mistake not, this binding of
Fenrir will prove a task too difficult even for
you."</p>

<p>Thor made no answer; but he seized Miölnir,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_267" id="Page_267" title="[Pg 267]"></a>
and, with sounding steps, strode to the smithy.
All night long the mighty blows of Miölnir rang
on the anvil, and the roaring bellows breathed a
hot blast over all the hill of Asgard. None of the
Æsir slept that night; but every now and then
one or other of them came to cheer Thor at his
work. Sometimes Frey brought his bright face
into the dusky smithy; sometimes Tyr entreated
permission to strike a stout blow; sometimes
Bragi seated himself among the workers, and,
with his eyes fixed on the glowing iron, poured
forth a hero song, to which the ringing blows
kept time.</p>

<p>There was also another guest, who, at intervals,
made his presence known. By the light of the
fire the evil form of Fenrir was seen prowling
round in the darkness, and every now and then
a fiendish, mocking laugh filled the pauses of the
song, and the wind, and the ringing hammer.</p>

<p>All that night and the next day Thor laboured
and Fenrir watched, and, at the time of the
evening meal, Thor strode triumphantly into
Father Odin's presence, and laid before him Læding,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_268" id="Page_268" title="[Pg 268]"></a>
the strongest chain that had ever yet been
forged on earth. The Æsir passed it from one to
another, and wondered at its immense length, and
at the ponderous moulding of its twisted links.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for Fenrir to break through
this," they said; and they were loud in their
thanks to Thor and praises of his prowess; only
Father Odin kept a grave, sad silence.</p>

<p>When Fenrir came into the court to receive
his food from Tyr, it was agreed that Thor and
Tyr were to seize and bind him. They held their
weapons in readiness, for they expected a fierce
struggle; but, to their surprise, Fenrir quietly
allowed the chain to be wound round him, and
lay down at his ease, while Thor, with two strokes
of Miölnir, rivetted the last link into one of the
strongest stones on which the court rested. Then,
when the Æsir were about to congratulate each
other on their victory, he slowly raised his ponderous
form, which seemed to dilate in the rising,
with one bound forward snapped the chain like
a silken thread, and walked leisurely to his lair,
as if no unusual thing had befallen him.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_269" id="Page_269" title="[Pg 269]"></a></p>

<p>The Æsir, with downcast faces, stood looking
at each other. Once more Thor was the first
to speak. "He who breaks through Læding," he
said, "only brings upon himself the still harder
bondage of Dromi." And having uttered these
words, he again lifted Miölnir from the ground,
and, weary as he was, returned to the smithy
and resumed his place at the anvil.</p>

<p>For three days and nights Thor worked, and,
when he once more appeared before Father Odin,
he carried in his hand Dromi&mdash;the "Strong Binding."
This chain exceeded Læding in strength
by one half, and was so heavy that Asa Thor himself
staggered under its weight; and yet Fenrir
showed no fear of allowing himself to be bound
by it, and it cost him very little more effort than
on the first evening to free himself from its fetters.</p>

<p>After this second failure Odin again called a
council of Æsir in Gladsheim, and Thor stood
among the others, silent and shamefaced.</p>

<p>It was now Frey who ventured first to offer
an opinion. "Thor, Tyr, and other brave sons
of the Æsir," he said, "have passed their lives<a class="pagenum" name="Page_270" id="Page_270" title="[Pg 270]"></a>
valiantly in fighting against giants and monsters,
and, doubtless, much wise lore has come to them
through these adventures. I, for the most part,
have spent my time peacefully in woods and fields,
watching how the seasons follow each other, and
how the silent, dewy night ever leads up the
brightly-smiling day; and, in this watching, many
things have been made plain to me which have
not, perhaps, been thought worthy of regard
by my brother Lords. One thing that I have
learned is, the wondrous strength that lies in
little things, and that the labour carried on
in darkness and silence ever brings forth the
grandest birth. Thor and Miölnir have failed to
forge a chain strong enough to bind Fenrir;
but, since we cannot be helped by the mighty
and renowned, let us turn to the unknown and
weak.</p>

<p>"In the caverns and dim places of the earth
live a tiny race of people, who are always working
with unwearied, noiseless fingers. With Asa Odin's
permission, I will send my messenger, Skirnir, and
entreat aid of them; and we shall, perhaps, find<a class="pagenum" name="Page_271" id="Page_271" title="[Pg 271]"></a>
that what passes the might of Asgard may be
accomplished in the secret places of Svartheim."</p>

<p>The face of Asa Odin brightened as Frey spoke,
and, rising immediately from his seat, he broke
up the council, and entreated Frey to lose no
time in returning to Alfheim and despatching
Skirnir on his mission.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_272" id="Page_272" title="[Pg 272]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="VII_II_THE_SECRET" id="VII_II_THE_SECRET"></a>PART II. THE SECRET OF SVARTHEIM.</h3>

<p>In spite of the cloud that hung over Asgard
all was fair and peaceful in Alfheim. Gerda,
the radiant Alf Queen, made there perpetual
sunshine with her bright face. The little elves
loved her, and fluttered round her, keeping up
a continual merry chatter, which sounded through
the land like the sharp ripple of a brook over
stony places; and Gerda answered them in low,
sweet tones, as the answering wind sounds among
the trees.</p>

<p>These must have been pleasant sounds to hear
after the ringing of Miölnir and the howling of
Fenrir; but Frey hardly gave himself time to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_273" id="Page_273" title="[Pg 273]"></a>
greet Gerd and his elves before he summoned
Skirnir into his presence, and acquainted him with
the danger that hung over Asgard, and the important
mission which the Æsir had determined to
trust to his sagacity. Skirnir listened, playing
with the knot of his wondrous sword, as he was
wont to do, in order to make known to every one
that he possessed it; for, to confess the truth, it
was somewhat too heavy for him to wield.</p>

<p>"This is a far different mission," he said, "from
that on which you once sent me&mdash;to woo fairest
Gerd; but, as the welfare of Asgard requires it,
I will depart at once, though I have little liking
for the dark caves and cunning people."</p>

<p>Frey thanked him, and, putting a small key
into his hand, which was, indeed, the key to the
gate of Svartheim, he bade him farewell, and Skirnir
set out on his journey.</p>

<p>The road from Alfheim to Svartheim is not
as long as you would be apt to imagine. Indeed,
it is possible for a careless person to wander from
one region to another without being at once aware
of it. Skirnir, having the key in his hand, took<a class="pagenum" name="Page_274" id="Page_274" title="[Pg 274]"></a>
the direct way. The entrance-gate stands at the
opening of a dim mountain-cave. Skirnir left
his horse without, and entered; the air was heavy,
moist, and warm, and it required the keenest
glances of Skirnir's keen eyes to see his way. Innumerable
narrow, winding paths, all leading downwards,
opened themselves before him. As he followed
the widest, a faint clinking sound of hammers
met his ear, and, looking round, he saw
groups of little men at work on every side. Some
were wheeling small wheelbarrows full of lumps
of shining metal along the ledges of the rock<span class="corr" title="was: :">;</span>
some, with elfin pickaxes and spades, were digging
ore from the mountain-side; some, herded together
in little caves, were busy kindling fires, or working
with tiny hammers on small anvils. As he continued
his downward path the last remnant of
daylight faded away; but he was not in total darkness,
for now he perceived that each worker carried
on his head a lantern, in which burned a pale,
dancing light. Skirnir knew that each light was
a Will-o'-the-wisp, which the dwarf who carried it
had caught and imprisoned to light him in his<a class="pagenum" name="Page_275" id="Page_275" title="[Pg 275]"></a>
work during the day, and which he must restore
to the earth at night.</p>

<p>For many miles Skirnir wandered on lower and
lower. On every side of him lay countless heaps
of treasure&mdash;gold, silver, diamonds, rubies, emeralds&mdash;which
the cunning workers stowed away silently
in their dark hiding-places. At length he came
to the very middle of the mountain, where the
rocky roof rose to an immense height, and where
he found himself in a brilliantly-lighted palace.
Here, in truth, were hung all the lights in the
world, which, on dark, moonless nights, are carried
out by dwarfs to deceive the eyes of men. Corpse-lights,
Will-o'-the-wisps, the sparks from glow-worms'
tails, the light in fire-flies' wings&mdash;these,
carefully hung up in tiers round and round the
hall, illuminated the palace with a cold blue light,
and revealed to Skirnir's eyes the grotesque and
hideous shapes of the tiny beings around him.
Hump-backed, cunning-eyed, open-mouthed, they
stood round, laughing, and whispering, and pointing
with shrivelled fingers. One among them, a little
taller than the rest, who sat on a golden seat<a class="pagenum" name="Page_276" id="Page_276" title="[Pg 276]"></a>
thickly set with diamonds, appeared to be a kind
of chief among them, and to him Skirnir addressed
his message.</p>

<p>Cunning and wicked as these dwarfs were, they
entertained a wholesome fear of Odin, having never
forgotten their one interview with him in Gladsheim;
and, therefore, when they heard from whom
Skirnir came, with many uncouth gesticulations
they bowed low before him, and declared themselves
willing to obey All-Father's commands.
They asked for two days and two nights in which
to complete their task, and during that time
Skirnir remained their guest in Svartheim.</p>

<p>He wandered about, and saw strange sights. He
saw the great earth central fire, and the swarthy,
withered race, whose task it is ceaselessly to feed
it with fuel; he saw the diamond-makers, who
change the ashes of the great fire into brilliants;
and the dwarfs, whose business it is to fill the
cracks in the mountain-sides with pure veins of
silver and gold, and lead them up to places where
they will one day meet the eyes of men. Nearer
the surface he visited the workers in iron and the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_277" id="Page_277" title="[Pg 277]"></a>
makers of salt-mines; he drank of their strange-tasting
mineral waters, and admired the splendour
of their silver-roofed temples and dwellings of
solid gold.</p>

<p>At the end of two days Skirnir re-entered the
audience-hall, and then the chief of the dwarfs
put into his hand a slender chain. You can
imagine what size it was when I tell you that the
dwarf chief held it lightly balanced on his forefinger;
and when it rested on Skirnir's hand it
felt to him no heavier than a piece of thistle-down.</p>

<p>The Svart King laughed loud when he saw the
disappointment on Skirnir's face. "It seems to
you a little thing," he said; "and yet I assure
you that in making it we have used up all the
materials in the whole world fit for the purpose.
No such chain can ever be made again, neither
will the least atom of the substances of which it
is made be found more. It is fashioned out of
six things. The noise made by the footfall of cats;
the beards of women; the roots of stones; the
sinews of bears; the breath of fish; and the spittle<a class="pagenum" name="Page_278" id="Page_278" title="[Pg 278]"></a>
of birds. Fear not with this to bind Fenrir; for
no stronger chain will ever be made till the end
of the world."</p>

<p>Skirnir now looked with wonder at his chain,
and, after having thanked the dwarfs, and promised
to bring them a reward from Odin, he set forth
on his road home, and, by the time of the evening
meal, reached Valhalla, and gladdened the hearts
of the Æsir by the tidings of his success.</p>

<hr class="secbreak" />

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_279" id="Page_279" title="[Pg 279]"></a></p>


<h3><a name="VII_III_HONOUR" id="VII_III_HONOUR"></a>PART III. HONOUR.</h3>

<p>Far away to the north of Asgard, surrounded by
frowning mountains, the dark lake, Amsvartnir,
lies, and, above the level of its troubled waters,
burns Lyngvi, the island of sweet broom, flaming
like a jewel on the dark brow of Hela. In this
lonely isle, to which no ship but Skidbladnir could
sail, the Æsir, with Fenrir in the midst, assembled
to try the strength of the dwarfs' chain.</p>

<p>Fenrir prowled round his old master, Tyr, with
a look of savage triumph in his cruel eyes,
now licking the hand that had so long fed him,
and now shaking his great head, and howling
defiantly. The Æsir stood at the foot of Giöll,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_280" id="Page_280" title="[Pg 280]"></a>
the sounding rock, and passed Gleipnir, the chain,
from one to another, talking about it, while Fenrir
listened. "It was much stronger than it looked,"
they said; and Thor and Tyr vied with each other
in their efforts to break it; while Bragi declared
his belief that there was no one among Æsir or
giants capable of performing so great a feat, "unless,"
he added, "it should be you, Fenrir."</p>

<p>This speech roused the pride of Fenrir; and,
after looking long at the slender chain and the
faces of the Æsir, he answered, "Loath am I to
be bound by this chain; but, lest you should
doubt my courage, I will consent that you should
bind me, provided one of you put his hand into
my mouth as a pledge that no deceit is intended."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence among the Æsir
when they heard this, and they looked at one
another. Odin looked at Thor, and Thor looked
at Bragi, and Frey fell behind, and put his hand
to his side, where the all-conquering sword, which
he alone could wield, no longer rested.</p>

<p>At length Tyr stepped forward valiantly, and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_281" id="Page_281" title="[Pg 281]"></a>
put his strong right hand, with which he had so
often fed him, into the wolf's cruel jaws.</p>

<p>At this signal the other Æsir threw the chain
round the monster's neck, bound him securely with
one end, and fastened the other to the great
rock Giöll. When he was bound Fenrir rose, and
shook himself, as he had done before; but in
vain he raised himself up, and bounded forward&mdash;the
more he struggled the more firmly the slender
chain bound him.</p>

<p>At this sight the Æsir set up a loud shout of
joy; for they saw their enemy conquered, and the
danger that threatened Asgard averted. Only Tyr
was silent, for in the struggle he had lost his hand.</p>

<p>Then Thor thrust his sword into the mouth of
Fenrir, and a foaming dark flood burst forth, roared
down the rock and under the lake, and began its
course through the country a turbid river. So
it will roll on till Ragnarök be come.</p>

<p>The sails of Skidbladnir now spread themselves
out to the wind; and the Æsir, seated in the
magic ship, floated over the lake silently in the
silent moonlight; while, from the top of Bifröst,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_282" id="Page_282" title="[Pg 282]"></a>
over the Urda fount and the dwelling of the Norns,
a song floated down. "Who," asked one voice, "of
all the Æsir has won the highest honour?" and,
singing, another voice made answer, "Tyr has won
the highest honour; for, of all the Æsir, he has
the most worthily employed his gift."</p>

<p>"Frey gave his sword for fairest Gerd."</p>

<p>"Odin bought for himself wisdom at the price of
his right eye."</p>

<p>"Tyr, not for himself, but for others, has sacrificed
his strong right hand."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The wolf Fenrir is annihilation; he was destined
to swallow the chief of the gods at Ragnarök.
We see him here as destruction chained until his
time for mischief should come again&mdash;the destructive
side of nature morally and physically is personified
in him. Why the dwarfs should be able to make a
chain strong enough to bind him, which the gods had
failed to do, is a puzzle. May it mean that subtlety
can compass ends which force has to relinquish,
or possibly a better thing than subtlety, gentleness?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_283" id="Page_283" title="[Pg 283]"></a></p>

<p>Tyr, who plays an important part in this myth,
was the son of Odin and a giantess. His name
means "Shining;" at one time he was probably a
chief of gods. He is also a sort of war god, something
like Thor, a finer hero, though, by a long way. Har
says of him, "he is the most daring and intrepid of
the gods, hence a man who surpasses all others
in valour is called Tyr-strong." His having only
one hand refers partly to his character of war god,
and means that the victory can only be awarded to
one side. "Thou never couldst settle a strife betwixt
two," was said to his shame, and, we may add, to
that of all war gods for ever.</p>

<p>Tyr gives his name to Tuesday, as Odin to
Wednesday, Thor to Thursday, and Freyja or Frigga
to Friday. Some suggest that Loki is the patron of
Saturday. He&mdash;Loki&mdash;forms the subject of the
next chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKI.</h2>


<p>After the death of Baldur, Loki never again ventured
to intrude himself into the presence of the
Æsir. He knew well enough that he had now done
what could never be forgiven him, and that, for the
future, he must bend all his cunning and vigilance
to the task of hiding himself for ever from the eyes
of those whom he had so injured, and escaping the
just punishment he had brought upon himself.</p>

<p>The world is large, and I am very cunning, said
Loki to himself, as he turned his back upon Asgard,
and wandered out into Manheim; there is no end
to the thick woods, and no measure for the deep
waters; neither is there any possibility of counting the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_286" id="Page_286" title="[Pg 286]"></a>
various forms under which I shall disguise myself.
All-Father will never be able to find me; I have
no cause to fear. But, though Loki repeated this
over and over again to himself, he <em>was</em> afraid.</p>

<p>He wandered far into the thick woods, and
covered himself with the deep waters; he climbed
to the tops of misty hills, and crouched in the
dark of hollow caves; but above the wood, and
through the water, and down into the darkness, a
single ray of calm, clear light seemed always to
follow him, and he knew that it came from the
eye of All-Father, who was watching him from
Air Throne.</p>

<p>Then he tried to escape the judging eye by
disguising himself under various shapes. Sometimes
he was an eagle on a lonely mountain-crag;
sometimes he hid himself as one among a troop
of timid reindeer; sometimes he lay in the nest
of a wood-pigeon; sometimes he swam, a bright-spotted
fish, in the sea; but, wherever he
was, among living creatures, or alone with dead
nature, everything seemed to know him, and to find
some voice in which to say to him, You are<a class="pagenum" name="Page_287" id="Page_287" title="[Pg 287]"></a>
Loki, and you have killed Baldur. Air, earth,
or water, there was no rest for him anywhere.</p>

<p>Tired at last of seeking what he could nowhere
find, Loki built himself a house by the side of a
narrow, glittering river which, at a lower point,
flashed down from a high rock into the sea below.
He took care that his house should have four doors
in it, that he might look out on every side, and catch
the first glimpse of the Æsir when they came, as
he knew they would come, to take him away.
Here his wife, Siguna, and his two sons, Ali and
Nari, came to live with him.</p>

<p>Siguna was a kind woman, far too good and
kind for Loki. She felt sorry for him now that
she saw he was in great fear, and that every living
thing had turned against him, and she would have
hidden him from the just anger of the Æsir if
she could; but the two sons cared little about their
father's dread and danger; they spent all their
time in quarrelling with each other; and their loud,
angry voices, sounding above the waterfall, would
speedily have betrayed the hiding-place, even if All-Father's
piercing eye had not already discovered it.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_288" id="Page_288" title="[Pg 288]"></a>
If only the children would be quiet, Siguna used
to say anxiously every day; but Loki said nothing;
he was beginning to know by experience that there
was that about his children that could never be
kept quiet or hidden away.</p>

<p>At last, one day when he was sitting in the
middle of his house looking alternately out of all
the four doors, and amusing himself as well as he
could by making a fishing net, he spied in the
distance the whole company of the Æsir approaching
his house. The sight of them coming all
together&mdash;beautiful, and noble, and free&mdash;pierced
Loki with a pang that was worse than death. He
rose without daring to look again, threw his net
on a fire that burned on the floor, and, rushing to
the side of the little river, he turned himself into
a salmon, swam down to the deepest, stillest pool
at the bottom, and hid himself between two stones.
The Æsir entered the house, and looked all round
in vain for Loki, till Kvasir, one of Odin's sons,
famous for his keen sight, spied out the remains
of the fishing-net in the fire; then Odin knew at
once that there was a river near, and that it was<a class="pagenum" name="Page_289" id="Page_289" title="[Pg 289]"></a>
there where Loki had hidden himself. He ordered
his sons to make a fresh net, and to cast it into
the water, and drag out whatever living thing they
could find there. It was done as he desired. Thor
held one end of the net, and all the rest of the Æsir
drew the other through the water. When they
pulled it up the first time, however, it was empty, and
they would have gone away disappointed, had not
Kvasir, looking earnestly at the meshes of the net,
discovered that something living had certainly touched
them. They then added a weight to the net, and
threw it with such force that it reached the bottom
of the river, and dragged up the stones in the pool.</p>

<p>Loki now saw the danger he was in of being
caught in the net, and, as there was no other way
of escape, he rose to the surface, swam down the
river as quickly as he could, and leaped over the
net into the waterfall. He swam and leaped quickly
as a flash of lightning, but not so quickly but that
the Æsir saw him, knew him through his disguise,
and resolved that he should no longer escape them.
They divided into two bands. Thor waded down
the river to the waterfall; the other Æsir stood<a class="pagenum" name="Page_290" id="Page_290" title="[Pg 290]"></a>
in a group below. Loki swam backwards and
forwards between them. Now he thought he would
dart out into the sea, and now that he would spring
over the net back again into the river. This last
seemed the readiest way of escape, and, with the
greatest speed, he attempted it. Thor, however,
was watching for him, and, as soon as Loki leaped
out of the water, he stretched out his hand, and
caught him while he was yet turning in the air.
Loki wriggled his slippery, slimy length through
Thor's fingers; but the Thunderer grasped him
tightly by the tail, and, holding him in this manner
in his hand, waded to the shore. There Father
Odin and the other Æsir met him; and, at Odin's
first searching look, Loki was obliged to drop his
disguise, and, cowering and frightened, to stand
in his proper shape before the assembled Lords.
One by one they turned their faces from him; for,
in looking at him, they seemed to see over again
the death of Baldur the Beloved.</p>

<p>I told you that there were high rocks looking
over the sea not far from Loki's house. One
of these, higher than the rest, had midway four<a class="pagenum" name="Page_291" id="Page_291" title="[Pg 291]"></a>
projecting stones, and to these the Æsir resolved
to bind Loki in such a manner that he should
never again be able to torment the inhabitants
of Manheim or Asgard by his evil-doings. Thor
proposed to return to Asgard, to bring a chain
with which to bind the prisoner; but Odin assured
him that he had no need to take such a journey,
"Loki," he said, "has already forged for himself
a chain stronger than any you can make. While we
have been occupied in catching him, his two sons,
Ali and Nari, transformed into wolves by their evil
passions, have fought with, and destroyed, each other.
With their sinews we must make a chain to bind
their father, and from that he can never escape."</p>

<p>It was done as Asa Odin said. A rope was
made of the dead wolves' sinews, and, as soon as it
touched Loki's body, it turned into bands of iron,
and bound him immoveably to the rock. Secured
in this manner the Æsir left him.</p>

<p>But his punishment did not end here. A
snake, whose fangs dropped venom, glided to the
top of the rock, and leaned his head over to peer
at Loki. The eyes of the two met and fixed<a class="pagenum" name="Page_292" id="Page_292" title="[Pg 292]"></a>
each other. The serpent could never move away
afterwards; but every moment a burning drop from
his tongue fell down on Loki's shuddering face.</p>

<p>In all the world there was only one who
pitied him. His kind wife ever afterwards stood
beside him, and held a cup over his head to catch
the poison. When the cup was full, she was
obliged to turn away to empty it, and drops of
poison fell again on Loki's face. He shuddered
and shrank from it, and the whole earth trembled.
So will he lie bound till Ragnarök be come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Loki, as we have seen all along, whatever his
origin may have been, had come to mean evil by
the time these myths were formed,&mdash;the destructive
principle, the originator of all corruption&mdash;as, father
of devouring Hel, of Fenrir, the wolf annihilator, and
of Jörmungand, the universal wolf. There is a curious
story in one of the <i>Eddas</i> about a feast which the
King of the Sea gave to the gods. By the way, one
song says of Ægir, "Sat the Rock-dweller, glad as a
child:" which is the introduction to another feast he<a class="pagenum" name="Page_293" id="Page_293" title="[Pg 293]"></a>
gave the gods. If he began by being glad on this
latter occasion, expecting a happy entertainment, he
must have had a grievous disappointment, for Loki,
bent on mischief, would insist upon feasting with the
Æsir. Things rarely went well where Loki was,
which the gods knew and begged him not to come.
But Loki would come, and directly he was seated
at the table he began his mischief-making, doing his
best to make the gods quarrel with one another,
insulting them by turns, reminding each of some fault
or misfortune least pleasant to remember. Altogether
it must have been a most uncomfortable dinner-party.
At last Thor, who had been on a journey,
came back; and, after a good deal of abuse had
passed between him and Loki, the latter appeared
to take alarm and slank away from his enraged
companions. One account says that it was immediately
after this the gods caught Loki and bound him,
but another does not mention his capture in connection
with Ægir's feast. Simrock says that Loki, in
his character of accuser at this banquet, represents
the guilty conscience of the gods. From this he
becomes the guilty conscience itself, a personification<a class="pagenum" name="Page_294" id="Page_294" title="[Pg 294]"></a>
of the consciousness of sin. His attempts at concealment,
the four doors of his house placed every
way that he might be alert in descrying danger, his
making the net by which he was caught (for the
Æsir were said to copy the net which they found
in Loki's house), his being bound with the entrails
of his own children&mdash;results of evil deeds&mdash;all carry
out this idea. He is, says Simrock, the Bad itself
as well as the consciousness of it. He is sin chained
as Fenrir is destruction chained. The gods are
moral power, they are his chains, for it is said that
when he shudders they tremble. And yet, how
real he has become in this myth, so much a <em>person</em>
that we can scarcely help wishing him to escape by
means of his ingenious disguises, and are certainly
glad that at last some one is left to pity him&mdash;the
faithful wife, standing by, who wards off from him
so much of his punishment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to Ragnarök; and "first," as Har
said, "there will come a winter." But that is not
exactly how we tell the story.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />
RAGNARÖK, OR THE TWILIGHT OF
THE GODS.</h2>


<p>Since the day that Baldur died no one had walked
in the bright halls of Broadblink&mdash;no one had
even stepped through the expanded gates. Instead
of undimmed brightness, a soft, luminous mist now
hung over the palace of the dead Asa, and the
Asyniur whispered to one another that it was haunted
by wild dreams.</p>

<p>"I have seen them," Freyja used to say; "I
have seen them float in at sunset through the
palace windows and the open doors; every evening I<a class="pagenum" name="Page_296" id="Page_296" title="[Pg 296]"></a>
can trace their slight forms through the rosy
mist; and I know that those dreams are wild and
strange from the shuddering that I feel when I
look at them, or if ever they glance at me."</p>

<p>So the Asyniur never went into Broadblink, and
though the Æsir did not think much about the
dreams, they never went there either.</p>

<p>But one day it happened that Odin stood in the
opening of the palace gates at sunset. The evening
was clear and calm, and he stood watching the
western sky until its crimson faded into soft
blue grey; then the colours of the flowers began
to mix one with another&mdash;only the tall white and
yellow blossoms stood out alone&mdash;the distance
became more dim. It was twilight, and there was
silence over the earth whilst the night and the
evening drew near to one another. Then a young
dream came floating through the gates into Broadblink.
Her sisters were already there; but she had
only just been born, and, as she passed Odin, she
touched him with a light hand, and drew him along
with her into the palace. She led him into the
same hall in which Baldur had dreamed, and there<a class="pagenum" name="Page_297" id="Page_297" title="[Pg 297]"></a>
Odin saw the night sky above him, and the broad
branches of Yggdrasil swaying in the breeze. The
Norns stood under the great ash; the golden threads
had dropped from their fingers; and Urd and Verdandi
stood one on each side of Skuld, who was
still veiled. For a long time the three stood
motionless, but at length Urd and Verdandi raised
each a cold hand, and lifted the veil slowly from
Skuld's face. Odin looked breathlessly within the
veil, and the eyes of Skuld dilated as he looked,
grew larger and larger, melted into one another,
and, at last, expanded into boundless space.</p>

<p>In the midst of space lay the world, with its
long shores, and vast oceans, ice mountains, and
green plains; Æsirland in the midst, with Manheim
all round it; then the wide sea, and, far off,
the frost-bound shores of Jötunheim. Sometimes
there was night and sometimes day; summer and
winter gave place to one another; and Odin watched
the seasons as they changed, rejoiced in the sunshine,
and looked calmly over the night.</p>

<p>But at last, during one sunrise, a wolf came
out of Jarnvid, and began to howl at the sun.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_298" id="Page_298" title="[Pg 298]"></a>
The sun did not seem to heed him, but walked
majestically up the sky to her mid-day point; then
the wolf began to run after her, and chased her
down the sky again to the low west. There the
sun opened her bright eye wide, and turned round
at bay; but the wolf came close up to her, and
opened his mouth, and swallowed her up. The
earth shuddered, and the moon rose. Another
wolf was waiting for the moon with wide jaws
open, and, while yet pale and young, he, too, was
devoured. The earth shuddered again; it was
covered with cold and darkness, while frost and
snow came driving from the four corners of heaven.
Winter and night, winter and night, there was
now nothing but winter.</p>

<p>A dauntless eagle sat upon the height of the
Giantess' Rock, and began to strike his harp.
Then a light red cock crowed over the Bird Wood.
A gold-combed cock crowed over Asgard, and over
Helheim a cock of sooty red. From a long way
underground Garm began to howl, and at last
Fenrir broke loose from his rock-prison, and ran
forth over the whole earth. Then brother contended<a class="pagenum" name="Page_299" id="Page_299" title="[Pg 299]"></a>
with brother, and war had no bounds. A
hard age was that.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4o">"An axe age,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A sword age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shields oft cleft in twain;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A storm age,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A wolf age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the earth met its doom."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Confusion rioted in the darkness. At length
Heimdall ran up Bifröst, and blew his Giallar
horn, whose sound went out into all worlds, and
Yggdrasil, the <a class="corr" name="corr_7" id="corr_7" title="was: might">mighty</a> ash, was shaken from its
root to its summit. After this Odin saw himself
ride forth from Asgard to consult Mimer at the
Well of Wisdom. Whilst he was there Jörmungand
turned mightily in his place, and began to
plough the ocean, which caused it to swell over
every shore, so that the world was covered with
water to the base of its high hills. Then the
ship Naglfar was seen coming over the sea with
its prow from the east, and the giant Hrym was the
steersman.</p>

<p>All Jötunheim resounded, and the dwarfs stood<a class="pagenum" name="Page_300" id="Page_300" title="[Pg 300]"></a>
moaning before their stony doors. Then heaven
was cleft in twain, and a flood of light streamed
down upon the dark earth. The sons of Muspell,
the sons of fire, rode through the breach, and at
the head of them rode the swarth Surt, their
leader, before and behind whom fire raged, and
whose sword outshone the sun. He led his flaming
bands from heaven to earth over Bifröst, and the
tremulous bridge broke in pieces beneath their
tread. Then the earth shuddered again; even
giantesses stumbled; and men trod the way to
Helheim in such crowds that Garm was sated with
their blood, broke loose, and came up to earth to
look upon the living. Confusion rioted, and Odin
saw himself, at the head of all the Æsir, ride
over the tops of the mountains to Vigrid, the
high, wide battle-field, where the giants were already
assembled, headed by Fenrir, Garm, Jörmungand,
and Loki. Surtur was there, too, commanding the
sons of fire, whom he had drawn up in several
shining bands on a distant part of the plain.</p>

<p>Then the great battle began in earnest. First,
Odin went forth against Fenrir, who came on,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_301" id="Page_301" title="[Pg 301]"></a>
opening his enormous mouth; the lower jaw
reached to the earth, the upper one to heaven,
and would have reached further had there been
space to admit of it. Odin and Fenrir fought for
a little while only, and then Fenrir swallowed the
Æsir's Father; but Vidar stepped forward, and, putting
his foot on Fenrir's lower jaw, with his hand
he seized the other, and rent the wolf in twain.
In the meantime Tyr and Garm had been fighting
until they had killed each other. Heimdall slew
Loki, and Loki slew Heimdall. Frey, Beli's
radiant slayer, met Surtur in battle, and was killed
by him. Many terrible blows were exchanged
ere Frey fell; but the Fire King's sword outshone
the sun, and where was the sword of Frey?
Thor went forth against Jörmungand; the strong
Thunderer raised his arm&mdash;he feared no evil&mdash;he
flung Miölnir at the monster serpent's head. Jörmungand
leaped up a great height in the air, and
fell down to the earth again without life; but a
stream of venom poured forth from his nostrils as
he died. Thor fell back nine paces from the
strength of his own blow; he bowed his head to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_302" id="Page_302" title="[Pg 302]"></a>
the earth, and was choked in the poisonous flood;
so the monster serpent was killed by the strong
Thunderer's hand; but in death Jörmungand slew
his slayer.</p>

<p>Then all mankind forsook the earth, and the
earth itself sank down slowly into the ocean.
Water swelled over the mountains, rivers gurgled
through thick trees, deep currents swept down the
valleys&mdash;nothing was to be seen on the earth but a
wide flood. The stars fell from the sky, and flew
about hither and thither. At last, smoky clouds
drifted upward from the infinite deep, encircling
the earth and the water; fire burst forth from the
midst of them, red flames wrapped the world,
roared through the branches of Yggdrasil, and
played against heaven itself. The flood swelled, the
fire raged; there was now nothing but flood and fire.</p>

<p>"Then," said Odin, in his dream, "I see the end
of all things. The end is like the beginning, and it
will now be for ever as if nothing had ever been."</p>

<p>But, as he spoke, the fire ceased suddenly; the
clouds rolled away; a new and brighter sun looked
out of heaven; and he saw arise a second time<a class="pagenum" name="Page_303" id="Page_303" title="[Pg 303]"></a>
the earth from ocean. It rose slowly as it had
sunk. First, the waters fell back from the tops of
new hills that rose up fresh and verdant; raindrops
like pearls dripped from the freshly budding
trees, and fell into the sea with a sweet sound;
waterfalls splashed glittering from the high rocks;
eagles flew over the mountain streams; earth arose
spring-like; unsown fields bore fruit; there was no
evil, and all nature smiled. Then from Memory's
Forest came forth a new race of men, who spread
over the whole earth, and who fed on the dew of
the dawn. There was also a new city on Asgard's
Hill&mdash;a city of gems; and Odin saw a new hall
standing in it, fairer than the sun, and roofed
with gold. Above all, the wide blue expanded, and
into that fair city came Modi and Magni, Thor's
two sons, holding Miölnir between them. Vali and
Vidar came, and the deathless Hœnir; Baldur
came up from the deep, leading his blind brother
Hödur peacefully by the hand; there was no longer
any strife between them. Two brothers' sons inhabited
the spacious Wind-Home.</p>

<p>Then Odin watched how the Æsir sat on the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_304" id="Page_304" title="[Pg 304]"></a>
green plain, and talked of many things. "Garm
is dead," said Höd to Baldur, "and so are Loki,
and Jörmungand, and Fenrir, and the world rejoices;
but did our dead brothers rejoice who fell
in slaying them?"</p>

<p>"They did, Höd," answered Baldur; "they
gave their lives willingly for the life of the world;"
and, as he listened, Odin felt that this was true;
for, when he looked upon that beautiful and happy
age, it gave him no pain to think that he must die
before it came&mdash;that, though for many, it was not
for him.</p>

<p>By-and-bye Hœnir came up to Höd and Baldur
with something glittering in his hand&mdash;something
that he had found in the grass; and as he approached
he said, "Behold the golden tablets, my brothers,
which in the beginning of time were given to the
Æsir's Father, and were lost in the Old World."</p>

<p>Then they all looked eagerly at the tablets, and,
as they bent over them, their faces became even
brighter than before.</p>

<p>"There is no longer any evil thing," said Odin;
"not an evil sight, nor an evil sound."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_305" id="Page_305" title="[Pg 305]"></a></p>

<p>But as he spoke dusky wings rose out of
Niflheim, and the dark-spotted serpent, Nidhögg,
came flying from the abyss, bearing dead carcases
on his wings&mdash;cold death, undying.</p>

<p>Then the joy of Odin was drowned in the tears
that brimmed his heart, and it was as if the
eternal gnawer had entered into his soul. "Is there,
then, no victory over sin?" he cried. "Is there
no death to Death?" and with the cry he woke.
His dream had faded from him. He stood in the
palace gates alone with night, and the night was
dying. Long since the rosy clasp of evening had
dropped from her; she had turned through darkness
eastward, and looked earnestly towards dawn.
It was twilight again, for the night and the morning
drew near to one another. A star stood in the
east&mdash;the morning star&mdash;and a coming brightness
smote the heavens. Out of the light a still
voice came advancing, swelling, widening, until it
filled all space. "Look forth," it said, "upon
the groaning earth, with all its cold, and pain, and
cruelty, and death. Heroes and giants fight and
kill each other; now giants fall, and heroes<a class="pagenum" name="Page_306" id="Page_306" title="[Pg 306]"></a>
triumph; now heroes fall, and giants rise; they
can but combat, and the earth is full of pain.
Look forth, and fear not; but when the worn-out
faiths of nations shall totter like old men, turn
eastward, and behold the light that lighteth every
man; for there is nothing dark it doth not lighten;
there is nothing hard it cannot melt; there is
nothing lost it will not save."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course the <i>Eddas</i> do not say anything about
Odin seeing Ragnarök in a dream, or about his
having any idea of a light that was to come; but,
divested of this slender veil, the story as it here
stands is almost an exact likeness of the northern
myth. In one <i>Edda</i> it is given as the prophecy of
a Vala or seeress, and the last line is "Now she will
descend," meaning that the Vala had finished her
prophesying, and would come down from her high
seat.</p>

<p>We have now heard a little about the Æsir,
those gods in whom Har said we were to
believe; and, are they like each other or unlike?<a class="pagenum" name="Page_307" id="Page_307" title="[Pg 307]"></a>
we ask ourselves. At first we say unlike, but after
thinking about them a little while, very much alike
indeed. It is certain that the <i>Eddas</i> speak of them
as distinct, but then, as we saw before, the <i>Eddas</i>
are not really very old; compared with the religion
they explain, they are almost young.</p>

<p>Simrock points out clearly the likenesses between
the gods&mdash;a very few of them we touch upon. Let
us begin, by putting in a line for ourselves to look
at, Odin, Tyr, Heimdall, Thor, Frey, and Baldur.
Odin&mdash;air, stormy and serene, the heavens with sun,
moon and stars; Odin the wanderer; Odin on Air-throne,
seeing over the whole world; Odin, the
Summer, as Odur; the patron of battles, the chooser
of the slain, the pledger of one eye, drinking from
Mimer's horn. Tyr, the shining, the warrior god,
the pledger of one hand. Heimdall, as Irmin,
the shining, a dweller upon heavenly mountains,
who sees and hears far off, who wanders over the
earth, blows his golden horn. Thor, whose dwelling
is the heavens; god of the storm, of cultivation;
the warrior, the chooser of the slain; for it is
said that whilst Odin had all the Jarls that<a class="pagenum" name="Page_308" id="Page_308" title="[Pg 308]"></a>
fell in battle, Thor claimed the Thralls for his
share. Frey, the Summer, god of the fruitful
year, the pledger of his sword. It is supposed that
Frey was once the husband of Freyja, and that it
was their separation which founded the myth of
Freyja's wanderings and tears; this would connect
him with Odur or Odin. Baldur, Summer, or Sun god,
pledges his life to the under-world. In leaving the
earth to weep for him, he recalls the desertion of Freyja
and her tears. Turning to the goddesses, we see
Jörd or the earth spoken of as a wife of Odin;
Rind, the winterly earth; Freyja, so nearly joined to
Frigg, the summerly earth; Idūna, the spring of the
earth; Gerda, also the winterly earth; Hela, the
under-world. What strikes us through all this is that
it would be natural for the early earth dwellers first
to worship the heavens with all that they contain
and suggest, whilst the action of heavenly influences
upon the earth would reveal her to them as the great
mother, stern, cold, tender, fruitful, consuming,
embosoming, reproducing all in one. There are
many ways in which gods and goddesses multiply.
In the first place Gylfis will begin to ask questions<a class="pagenum" name="Page_309" id="Page_309" title="[Pg 309]"></a>
and pry into first causes and ways and means of
existence, whence would easily arise a division of
nature into elementary powers, air, water, fire, to say
nothing of the giants and chaotic regions which
would suggest themselves. One side or another of
life must always be uppermost, and nature in its
differences grows into new personalities; from nature
myths again moral ones easily <a class="corr" name="corr_8" id="corr_8" title="was: develope">develop</a>, and new
variations meet the new requirements. Again, tribe
joins tribe and pantheons mingle, the chief god of
one race becoming the son, say, or the brother, of
another tribe's chief god, and so on.</p>

<p>The fact of Thor receiving Thralls in battle whilst
Odin claimed the Jarls, looks as if Thor had fallen
at one time from the first to a second place.
Simrock says that Tyr answers to Zeus, and that
perhaps he was the oldest of the Asgard gods; but
he says also that Odin has gathered up into himself
all the highest attributes of the gods. The only
allusions that can be relied on as genuine which the
<i>Eddas</i> contain to a higher god than Odin is one
very obscure strophe in the <span class="sic" title="[sic]">Voluspa</span> which says
speaking of Ragnarök,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_310" id="Page_310" title="[Pg 310]"></a>
<span class="i0o">"Then comes the Mighty One,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great judgment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The powerful from above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rules over all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall doom pronounce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strifes allay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holy peace establish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shall ever be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Another still more difficult to understand in Hyndla's
lay,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"Then shall another come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet mightier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although I dare not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name declare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few may see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Further forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than when Odin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meets the Wolf."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Simrock, however, thinks that he sees some gleams
of a higher unseen Hidden Power very faintly here
and there, and between this Being and Odin he
also fancies that he can trace some connection. But
he is very uncertain on the point.</p>

<p>Simrock says of the goddesses in the Scandinavian
mythology that they most of them represent only
one side of the original Earth Mother, dividing<a class="pagenum" name="Page_311" id="Page_311" title="[Pg 311]"></a>
the double nature between them; so we see some
personating the fruitful, beneficent, life-giving renovating
earth, whilst Hela has only the dark side
left in her nature. It is, however, to be observed that
whilst half a corpse she is half a woman. Gerda
and Idūna are mixed in nature, also Rinda and
others of Odin's giantess wives. He says, also,
that Hela is the eldest of the goddesses, and that the
root idea remains with her,&mdash;a receiver of the dead,
as earth is,&mdash;though she became so degraded. Odin
gave her power over nine worlds, and here we see
a trace of the old idea of her being the great Earth
Mother. "From a goddess of the underworld to
a goddess of death is one step. A goddess of the
underworld should be life-giving as well as destroying;
but soon the heathen horror of death appears, and
the destroyer is looked upon as the ender only, not
the fresh begetter;" she becomes a hunger that will
not be satisfied, and hence Hela is a daughter of
Loki.</p>

<p>Out of the flood, into the flood again,&mdash;Niflheim
and Muspelheim join hands in the twilight.
As in the first beginning of things we saw the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_312" id="Page_312" title="[Pg 312]"></a>
strange waves alternately frozen and melted by these
antagonistic powers, and out of this antagonism
a form&mdash;so in Ragnarök we see the flood once
more supreme, the rival forces, cold and heat, both
fighting against the formed, ordered world&mdash;both,
because both alike represent elemental forces which
must precede formation. So, also, a second time the
world emerges out of the struggle, Simrock thinks, a
renewed world morally and physically; and certainly
it does seem to have made some advance upon the
old order of things,&mdash;it stands forth beautiful at once.
But does this mean any more, we wonder, than the
golden age come back, with fate in the back-ground.
So many of the same powers seem to be at work
in the two worlds, that we can only think of a
succession of events in looking at the picture. We
see again the golden tables, we see Hödur as well
as Baldur. There is one very obscure verse which
seems to imply that the giant fate-maidens are in the
renewed world. Sons succeed their fathers. Odin's
sons inherit Odin's hall; the two mentioned are Vali
and Vidar, who were both descended from giantesses,
and giants always typify the baser part of nature.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_313" id="Page_313" title="[Pg 313]"></a>
Thor's sons retain the badge of warfare. On the
other hand, it is said that Höd and Baldur come up
<em>peacefully</em> together from the deep; it has been
remarked, also, that no Vanir gods (inferior to those
of Asgard) are mentioned. There is also a strophe
in the Völuspa which talks of peace established, and
of heavenly Gimill, gold bedecked, where the righteous
people are to dwell for evermore, and enjoy
happiness&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"She a Hall sees standing than the sun brighter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gold bedecked in Gimill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There shall the righteous people dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for evermore happiness enjoy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">But again, immediately following these hopeful
strains, we are shown the dark-spotted snake&mdash;the
Eternal Gnawer, with a corpse upon his wings.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0o">"The dark dragon flying from beneath, the glistening serpent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his wings bears Nidhögg, flying o'er the plain a corpse."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our ears are puzzled by the strain, and we cannot
catch the melody's last tone. Is it a joy note or a
wail? from Gimill's gold roofs, from the shore
of corpses? "Who can search into the beginning;
who can search into the end?"</p>
